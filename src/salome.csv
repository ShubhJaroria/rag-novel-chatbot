she stood leaning against the garden gate sore at heart until a chill mist from the sea crept upwards and surrounded her then she retreated into the cottage and waited patiently listening to the ticking of the tall eightday clock in the kitchen,novel

she knew her father would not return till the doors of the inn were shut for the night,novel
"oh wow, that must have been scary. i hope you were able to get out of there quickly.",chit-chat

salome stood looking at him the tears running down her cheeks mingled love and indignation in her aching heart,novel
"hello, salome. how are you? i hope you're having a good day.",chit-chat

i'm so sorry to hear about mrs fowler. i hope she's doing well.,chit-chat
the little girl lay awake wondering what trouble her mother could possibly have or if she was only nervous and imaginative and it was not until the first streaks of dawn peeped into the room that she slept too,novel

before however she had time to dwell much upon the matter the door opened and her mother entered fully dressed bearing a breakfast tray in her hands which she placed on the dressingtable,novel

miss conway begged him to sit still but he would not obey her,novel

mrs fowler spoke with decision in her tones she was evidently determined to do her shopping alone,novel

she was evidently glad to reach greystone,novel

i expect she is really very tired margaret reflected but does not like to confess it,novel
that's a shame. i'm sure she'll get over it soon enough.,chit-chat
and she was confirmed in this opinion when she saw how quiet and languid mrs fowler appeared during the evening,novel
that's interesting. did you find out who she was or what she was up to?,chit-chat
she did not request miss conway to play to her as she usually did but lay on the sofa with a book in her lap yawning occasionally as though weary of the day so that neither margaret nor the governess were surprised when she declared her intention of going to bed early,novel

indeed she offered me a glass of wine,novel

you did not take it,novel
"i did take it, but i didn't think it would be a good idea to take it.",chit-chat
the governess interposed hastily,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you saying that you don't know what you're talking about?,chit-chat
oh no,novel
"yeah, i'm not sure if i'll be able to do it again...",chit-chat

there was silence for a few minutes,novel

"hello, margaret. how are you doing today? i hope you are having a good day.",chit-chat
she was prepared to see her exhibit surprise and perhaps disapproval but miss conway appeared absolutely frightened and her very lips turned white,novel
what did miss conway do to make you think she was going to do something that she didn't want to do?,chit-chat

i can't imagine what it must have been like to experience that. i hope she's okay now.,chit-chat
she watched miss conway fling the windows open wide and place a blanket carefully over her mothers unconscious form and the conviction grew upon her that though the governess was deeply grieved she was not surprised and shocked as she herself was and poor ross who looked almost scared to death,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope she's okay. what happened to her?,chit-chat

had her father anticipated this hour for her,novel

for a few minutes margaret stood perfectly still,novel

then the sound of geralds voice in the hall below reminded her that she must as miss conway had said put a brave face on matters,novel
i love geralds! he's such a great character. what's your favorite character?,chit-chat
so she went downstairs and delighted her brother by promising to take him down to the beach,novel

she was conscious that the burden of a great sorrow was upon her and she felt bowed down with an intolerable weight of shame,novel

she longed to ask for her mother but for the present she was incapable of speech,novel

her sobs had ceased now and she could speak collectedly,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to talk to her now.,chit-chat

she asked anxiously,novel
"i'm not sure what anxxing means, but i've never heard of it.",chit-chat
i am sure she has not nor do i believe she will,novel

poor soul she has been telling me how sorely she was tempted,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she's able to get over it.,chit-chat
oh margaret this all comes of mrs lutes offering her that glass of wine,novel

she had not touched a stimulant since her illness till then and had almost lost her craving for drink,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she's better now. what happened to her?,chit-chat
that glass of wine however was too much for her and she felt she must have more,novel

i need not dwell on the result,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what's going on in your life right now?,chit-chat

sinceoh long before her illness,novel

oh my dear i see you guess it all,novel
it's been a long time since i've been in a relationship. i don't know what i'm going to do.,chit-chat
your father hoped you would never know,novel
"that's what i thought too, but he didn't want me to think it was him.",chit-chat
he trusted that the complete change from life in town to the quietude of the country where mrs fowler would meet comparatively few people of her own class and where he believed she would be free from temptation would ultimately cure her of the fatal habit she had acquired of drinking to excess and i believe that would have been the happy result if you had not unfortunately met mrs lute,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're doing better now. what happened to mrs. lute?,chit-chat
little does mrs lutegood kind creature that she isdream of the mischief she has wrought,novel
that's really sweet of her. i'm sure she's a good person.,chit-chat

that's so sweet of her. i'm sure she's very proud of you.,chit-chat
he loves her too well for that,novel
"yeah, it's a good thing to do. i'm glad she's doing well for herself.",chit-chat
margaret felt at that moment that her affection for her mother was being swallowed up by a sickening sensation of disgust,novel
i don't think i've ever felt that way about my mother. did you?,chit-chat
she had always loved her very dearly and had been so pleased and happy when people had admired her for her beauty and winning ways,novel
that's really sweet of her. i'm sure she had a lot of great memories.,chit-chat
even when mrs fowler had openly shown her preference for gerald of her two children the little girl though often hurt had never evinced any jealousy or resentment,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did mrs fowler do to hurt her little girl?,chit-chat
she had accepted the fact that gerald was her mothers favourite and had loved her none the less on that account,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she's able to get over it.,chit-chat
but now her love was being tried very severely,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
the remembrance of mrs fowler as she had last seen her lying on the bed with flushed cheeks breathing stertorously was absolutely revolting to her,novel
i can't imagine what that must have been like. i'm sorry to hear that.,chit-chat
she had many times asked herself how salome could continue to love her drunken father now she asked herself was it possible that she could continue to love her drunken mother,novel
that's a good question. i think it's possible that she could continue to love her mother.,chit-chat
oh the horror of the thought that one so gentle and refined should be on a par with josiah petherick fellowvictim to a disgraceful degrading sin,novel
i don't think i've ever heard of josiah petherick. what does she do?,chit-chat
perhaps miss conway guessed some of the thoughts which were passing through her companions mind for she watched her anxiously and presently remarked i daresay you can faintly imagine how your poor mother is feeling now,novel
that's a very interesting theory. i'm not sure if it's true or not.,chit-chat
she had hoped to keep the secret of her weakness and sin from your knowledge,novel
"that's a good way to look at it, but i still feel bad for her.",chit-chat
your father too will be terribly troubled when he hears you have learnt the truth but i do not doubt dear child that god in his wisdom has ordered all for the best,novel
i don't know... i'm not sure if i can trust him.,chit-chat
you will understand now as you never did before how much mrs fowler needs all your love and devotion,novel
that's true. i'm not sure if i'll ever be able to live without her.,chit-chat
you can help her if you will to the restoration of that selfrespect which once lost is so hard to regain,novel
i don't know how to do that. i'm not sure what i want to do.,chit-chat
you can show her by loving her as unfalteringly as salome loves her erring father that she can rise above this habit which has done so much to ruin her health and happiness and earn everyones respect and her own as well,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i think i'll do that.,chit-chat
miss conway paused and there was a solemn silence which margaret at length broke by saying with a sob i do love mother i do indeed,novel
that's so funny! i've never heard of miss conway. what's her name?,chit-chat
i am sure of it,novel
i'm not sure what to do with myself. i don't know what i want to do.,chit-chat

i'm glad to hear that. it's always nice to have someone agree with you.,chit-chat
see what a lot of friends she had in town and how popular she was,novel
"that's a good idea, i'll have to do that. what did she do?",chit-chat
she was always going about yes dear i know the governess interposed and that was how it was she commenced taking stimulants,novel
i love ulants! they're so good for the body and the mind.,chit-chat
she used to get tired with her constant gaieties and then she would take a glass of wine or some other intoxicant to revive her until she grew to like stimulants and took more and more,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she's able to get over it.,chit-chat
the craving increased and she drank to the injury of her health yet no outsiders guessed it,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she's doing better now. what happened to her?,chit-chat
then she had nervous attacks followed at last by a serious illness,novel
"oh no, i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope she's okay.",chit-chat
the doctors told your father she was killing herself and immeasurably horrified he took the only course he saw could save his wifebecame a teetotaler himself and insisted that his household should follow suit,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get through it.,chit-chat
mrs fowler knew he was acting wisely and for her sake but she would not admit it,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did he do to make you think he was acting wisely?,chit-chat
however she found total abstinence from all intoxicants was restoring her to health and had made up her mind never to touch a stimulant again when temptation was put in her way and she fell,novel
that's so sad. i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she's doing better now.,chit-chat
god grant she may prove stronger in the future,novel
that's what i'm thinking. i think she's going to do great.,chit-chat
now my dear tell me have you had any supper,novel
"i haven't had supper yet, but i'm going to have some tonight. what about you?",chit-chat
no margaret replied i am not in the least hungry,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get some soon.,chit-chat

"i try to eat, but it's hard because i'm hungry all the time.",chit-chat
come with me,novel
came here to say this. have you heard of come with me? it's an american rock band.,chit-chat
margaret demurred at first but her governess overruled all her objections,novel
margaret demurred was one of my favorite authors. she was an american novelist and novelist.,chit-chat
and after she had bathed her tearstained face the two went downstairs and had supper together,novel
"oh my god, that's so gross! i'm so sorry to hear that.",chit-chat
miss conway did not leave her pupil again until she saw her comfortably tucked up in bed for the night then she kissed her bade her try to sleep well and left her to herself,novel
i love miss conway! she's such a great singer and songwriter. what's your favorite song by her?,chit-chat
and margaret did sleep well absolutely worn out with excitement and grief whilst the governess spent the night in mrs fowlers room,novel
"i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're feeling better now, margaret.",chit-chat
at daybreak ross came to take miss conways place and found her mistress sleeping tranquilly,novel
that's terrible. did you find out who she was? did you confront her about it?,chit-chat
she looks more like herself miss doesnt she,novel
i think so too. i don't know what i'm going to do about it.,chit-chat
she whispered gladly,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm not sure i could do that.,chit-chat
yes miss conway answered i should let her sleep as long as she will,novel
that's a good idea. i'm sure she'll be happy to hear that.,chit-chat
she did not say what a harrowing time she had endured during that night watch or how mrs fowler had implored her to give her a stimulant and had declared she would die without it,novel
i don't think she said what a harrowing time she had endured during that night watch or how mrs fowler had implored her to give her a stimulant and had declared she would die without it.,chit-chat
but she went away quietly to her own room and before she lay down to rest prayed earnestly to almighty god for the unhappy woman whom she pitied from the depths of her heart,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she's doing better now. what happened?,chit-chat

early in the morning a telegram arrived from mr fowler saying he would be at home that night and ordering the carriage to be sent to n to meet him at the railway station,novel
that's really nice of mr fowler. did you get to meet him at the railway station?,chit-chat

i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope she's okay. i've never been in a situation like that before.,chit-chat
it was nearly eight oclock before mr fowler reached home,novel

margaret who had spent most of the day on the beach with my brother shrank sensitively from the thought of meeting her father,chit-chat
when she heard the carriage wheels nearing the house she longed to run away and hide but she knew it would never do to act in such a cowardly fashion as that,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope she didn't get hurt too badly.,chit-chat
appearances must be kept up at any rate before the servants so she went to the front door with gerald to meet mr fowler and returned his loving kiss as quietly and composedly as though her heart was not beating almost to suffocation,novel
that's really sweet of him. i'm sure he's a great person.,chit-chat
as she had anticipated he immediately went upstairs to his wifes room and it was not until much later that she found herself with him alone,novel
"wow, that must have been scary. how long did it take for her to find him?",chit-chat
then after gerald had gone to bed he joined her in the garden and strolled up and down the lawn by her side his arm around her shoulders,novel
that's really sweet of him. i'm glad he didn't do that to her.,chit-chat
for some minutes he did not speak and she could not see the expression of his face for there was no moon and the stars gave but little light,novel

returning from an evenings fishing an hour previously he had been stopped in the village on his way home by silas moyle who had poured into his ears an excited tale about josiah whom silas had taken upon himself to remonstrate with upon his cruel conduct to his daughter on the previous night with the result that josiah inflamed with drink had struck him and had received in return a black eye and an injured cheek,novel
"i'm so sorry to hear that, josiah. i hope you're ok.",chit-chat
you know sir im a man of peace and dont hold with brawling silas had said but i own i lost my temper tonight,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
josiahs a regular blackguard when hes drunk,novel
i've never heard of josiahs before. is he a famous blackguard?,chit-chat
it was foolish to remonstrate with a drunken man mr amyatt had answered,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to recover from it.,chit-chat
had you spoken to him in his sober moments your words might have had a very different effect,novel
"i didn't, but i think you're right. it's hard to tell sometimes.",chit-chat
where is josiah now,novel
"i'm not sure, but i do know that josiah is an american singer and songwriter.",chit-chat
gone home swearing vengeance against me sir,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. did you have a lot of fun in the house?,chit-chat
my great fear is that hell do some harm to poor salome,novel
that's a good point. i don't know what i'd do without her.,chit-chat
that had been the vicars fear too,novel
"yes, it was. i felt so bad about it, but it was worth it in the end.",chit-chat
so instead of going straight to the vicarage as he had intended he had retraced his footsteps to the pethericks cottage and now stood waiting for admittance at the door,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i think i would have done the same.,chit-chat
as no one answered his knock he rapped louder and listened,novel
that's cool. what did he rap about? i've never heard of him before.,chit-chat
for a few moments there was silence then came the sound of heavy dragging footsteps and josiah opened the door and demanded hoarsely who was there,novel
that's so annoying. i hate when people do that. what did josiah do?,chit-chat
it is i petherick the vicar answered stepping uninvited across the threshold,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm sure you'll be fine. what did you do?,chit-chat
where is your daughter,novel
she's at home with her mom and dad. it's been a long time since they've been together.,chit-chat
he asked fixing his eyes upon the fisherman who stood staring at him in a dazed fashion,novel
what did he do to fix his eyes? did he get hit by a car or something?,chit-chat
receiving no reply he turned into the kitchen an exclamation of horror and dismay breaking from his lips as he caught sight of the small slight figure of the lame girl lying near the fireplace,novel
"oh my god, that's terrible! i'm so sorry to hear that. what did you do?",chit-chat
very tenderly he lifted her and placed her in the one easychair in the room calling to josiah to bring some water immediately,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. it must have been very hard for him to do that.,chit-chat
water,novel
do you like water? it's a liquid form of water that can be used as a source of energy.,chit-chat
questioned josiah stupidly,novel
"i don't know much about josiah, but i do know that it's a branch of hinduism.",chit-chat
what for,novel
i'm not sure. i just don't know what to do. it's been so long since i've been in a relationship.,chit-chat
shes dead,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope she's doing well. what happened to her?,chit-chat
shes been dead this halfhour or more but i havent dared touch her,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to talk to her about it.,chit-chat
salome salome,novel
do you like salome salads? they are salads that are made from salads.,chit-chat
ive killed you my poor maid,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she's ok. what did you do?,chit-chat
your own fathers killed you salome and flinging himself on his knees at his daughters side josiah wept like a child,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
dont be foolish petherick mr amyatt said sternly,novel
"i don't know what that means, but i'm not sure it means what you think it means.",chit-chat
he had been feeling salomes pulse and had ascertained that it beat though feebly,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
shes not dead but she has fainted,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she's doing better now. what happened to her?,chit-chat
come be a man,novel
"i don't want to be a man, i'm not a man at all.",chit-chat
pull yourself together and fetch some water at once,novel
that's a good idea. i'm not sure if i can do that though.,chit-chat
not dead josiah cried excitedly,novel
i'm not familiar with josiah. what's her name? i've never heard of her.,chit-chat
are you sure,novel
"yes, i'm sure i'll be fine. it's been a long time since i've been in a relationship.",chit-chat
then god be thanked for that,novel
i'm sure he was. he's always been kind to me and i've always been grateful for him.,chit-chat
he rose from his knees and went into the yard returning in a few seconds with a basin of water,novel
oh no! i hope he didn't get hurt. did you have to clean it up?,chit-chat
very gently the vicar bathed salomes white face until her eyelids flickered and a faint colour stole to her lips,novel
"oh my god, that's so creepy! i'm so sorry to hear that.",chit-chat
josiah sobered by fright explained what had happened not sparing himself but declaring he would not have injured a hair of his daughters head if he could have helped it for mr amyatt must know how much he loved her,novel
i'm not familiar with josiah but i know she's a great actress.,chit-chat
tush petherick,novel
do you like tush petherick? it's an american dish made in the united states.,chit-chat
the vicar responded impatiently mingled pity and disgust in his tone,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
dont talk to me of your love for salome,novel
"don't talk to me about my love for salome, i love you!!!",chit-chat
a nice way you have of showing it,novel
"yeah, it's a great way to show off. i'm so proud of him.",chit-chat
last night you turned her out of doors in torrents of rain i was drunk josiah interposed hastily,novel
oh no! i hope you were able to get her out of the house. what did you do?,chit-chat
she riled me she did with her tears and having been drunk is no excuse mr amyatt interrupted in his turn,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
not content with your scandalous conduct last night you must continue your unmanly behaviour today and knock salome down and no no said a weak voice at this point,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
it was salome who spoke,novel
that's interesting. what did you say to him? did he say something to you?,chit-chat
she had regained consciousness and was sufficiently herself to understand what was going on,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad she's okay.,chit-chat
no no she repeated it was an accident,novel
that's what i'm thinking. i don't know what to do now.,chit-chat
he did not mean to hurt me,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
i shook her andand pushed her josiah admitted looking thoroughly ashamed of himself,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do to make her feel better about it?,chit-chat
i meant her no harm sir but i was rough andoh salome can you ever forgive me,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
and the wretched man turned appealingly to the little figure in the easychair,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did he do to make you feel that way?,chit-chat
yes was the faint response,novel
"yes, it was. i was so happy to be able to talk to him about it.",chit-chat
ii dont think im much hurt,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you feel better soon. what did you do?,chit-chat
are you in pain,novel
"no, i'm fine. it's just that i don't know what to do with myself.",chit-chat
mr amyatt asked gently,novel
have you ever seen mr amamonic asked gently? it's an american tv series.,chit-chat
no sir but my forehead is very sore,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope it gets better for you. do you have any hobbies?,chit-chat
i must have knocked it in falling,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i hope you didn't get hurt.,chit-chat
yes poor child i see you did there is a big bruise coming,novel
"yeah, i'm so mad at him. i don't know what to do.",chit-chat
i suppose i fainted,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. did you have to go through a lot of pain?,chit-chat
she inquired looking wistfully from the vicar to her father who was regarding her in gloomy silence,novel
that's so sad. i hope she's doing well. i'm sure she'll be fine.,chit-chat
yes that was it you fainted mr amyatt replied,novel
"yes, it was. i was so happy when i found out it was my first time.",chit-chat
but you are much better now and after a good nights rest i have no doubt you will be almost yourself again,novel
i hope so. it's been a long time since i've had a good night's rest.,chit-chat
salome glanced at her crutches which were lying on the ground,novel
"hello, how are you doing today? i just got back from a long day at work.",chit-chat
mr amyatt picked them up and placed them against her chair,novel
that's so nice of mr. amto do that for you. what did you do with them?,chit-chat
thank you sir she said gratefully lifting her brown eyes shyly to his face which expressed so plainly his sympathy and concern,novel
that's very nice of her. i'm glad she's feeling better about herself.,chit-chat
i think i shall be all right now she added,novel
that's great! what did she add? i'm looking forward to meeting her.,chit-chat
thank you for being so kind,novel
you're welcome. i'm glad you like it. it's nice to have someone to talk to.,chit-chat
does that mean you wish me to go,novel
"i wish i could go, but i'm not sure if i'll be able to.",chit-chat
he queried with a smile,novel
"awww, that's so cute! i'm sure he had a great day!",chit-chat
well i dont know that i can do any good by remaining longer,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you can find a way to do it.,chit-chat
good night my dear,novel
"thank you, i hope you have a good night too. i'm sure you'll have a great time.",chit-chat
he took salomes small thin hand and pressed it reassuringly then beckoned to her father to follow him to the door,novel
"wow, that's pretty crazy. i'm glad he didn't do it again.",chit-chat
you must have someone in to see to that poor child tonight petherick he said gravely,novel
"i don't have anyone to see him tonight, but i'm sure he'll be fine.",chit-chat
can you call upon assistance from one of your neighbours,novel
i'm not sure how to do that. i don't know what to do.,chit-chat
josiah shook his head doubtfully,novel
josiah shook his head doubtfully. she's a great singer and songwriter.,chit-chat
then shall i ask mrs moyle to look in and help get salome to bed,novel
that sounds like a good idea. i'm sure she'll be happy to help.,chit-chat
the vicar suggested,novel
i don't think i've ever heard of the vicar. what's it about?,chit-chat
a dull shamed flush rose to the fishermans face and he began to stammer something about not knowing whether mrs moyle would come inside his doors seeing he had quarrelled with her husband only that evening but the vicar cut him short,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he didn't have to go through that.,chit-chat
i know all about that petherick,novel
"yeah, it's pretty cool. i've never been to a petherick before.",chit-chat
silas moyle told me the tale himself not an hour ago,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did silas moyle tell you about the tale?,chit-chat
i heard it with great regret for silas is a sincere wellwisher of yours and he and his wife would do anything in the world for your little girl,novel
thank you so much for your kind words. i really appreciate it. i'm so proud of him.,chit-chat
you had better let me send mrs moyle to youthat is if she will come perhaps she will not,novel
that's a good idea. i'm sure she'll be happy to hear that.,chit-chat
shall i be the bearer of an apology from you to silas,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you referring to me or silas?,chit-chat
im sorry i hit him josiah acknowledged truthfully,novel
i'm sorry that you hit him josiah. i hope you're ok.,chit-chat
shall i tell him that,novel
"that would be nice, but i don't think i'd be able to handle it.",chit-chat
if you please sir,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you referring to me as a sir?,chit-chat
i admit i deserved what he gave me,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do to deserve what he gave you?,chit-chat
oh sir ive had a fine fright this night,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay. what did you do?,chit-chat
i thought id killed salome,novel
oh no! why did you think that? did you have a bad experience with salome?,chit-chat
you might have done so,novel
i didn't. i'm not going to do it again. i don't know what to do.,chit-chat
then i should have been a murderer josiah groaned,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
im a bad lot sir thats what i am,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what are you doing to make yourself a better person?,chit-chat
he seemed perfectly sober now so mr amyatt spoke a few solemn words to him imploring him for the sake of his little daughter to give up the drink and take the pledge,novel
"oh wow, that's really interesting. i didn't know he was sober now.",chit-chat
josiah declared he would think seriously about doing so and went back to salome whilst the vicar hurried in search of mrs moyle,novel
what did josiah do to make you think he would think seriously about doing something like that?,chit-chat
at first that good woman kindhearted and fond of the lame girl though she was said nothing would make her enter the doors of one who had so insulted her husband as had josiah,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
but on silas adding his entreaties to the vicars she gave in and betook herself to the pethericks cottage where after having assisted salome upstairs and put her to bed she declared her intention of remaining for the night,novel
that sounds like a lot of work. i'm sorry you had to go through that.,chit-chat
she was not going to leave that poor motherless lamb as she called salome in the house alone with a maniac,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did she do to make you feel that way?,chit-chat
josiah petherick did not look much like a maniac however as he sat in the kitchen listening to mrs moyles scathing remarks as she put away the supper things,novel
josiah petherick did not look much like a maniac however as he sat in the kitchen listening to mrs moyles scathing remarks as she put away the supper things,chit-chat
he was in a wonderfully subdued and repentant frame of mind and sat with his elbows on the table and his aching head resting in his hands,novel
that's pretty cool. what did you do to make him repentant of himself?,chit-chat
at last he could bear his companions home thrusts no longer and exclaimed good gracious woman do you imagine i dont know what a beast i am,novel
i don't know what a beast i am either. i'm not sure what to do with myself.,chit-chat
well if you do know it why dont you turn over a new leaf,novel
i don't think i can do that. i'm not sure if i can.,chit-chat
she inquired,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you referring to the fact that she's a woman?,chit-chat
i mind what a steady young fellow you used to be,novel
thank you. it's been a long time since i've been in a relationship.,chit-chat
youre too easily led thats what you are,novel
i don't know... i'm not sure if i want to be.,chit-chat
make up your mind to give up the drink,novel
that's what i'm trying to do. i don't want to give up the drink.,chit-chat
i cantnot entirely its got too strong a hold on me he confessed,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
thats the way of it,novel
"i know, it's been a long time since i've done anything like that.",chit-chat
well youll have to choose between drink and salomethats my opinionfor youre killing her by slow degrees,novel
i think i'm going to go with salomethats. i don't know what to do now.,chit-chat
josiah started but mrs moyle did not pursue the subject further,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. josiah is one of my favorite authors. have you read any of her books?,chit-chat
she told him he had better go to bed and make no noise to disturb his daughter,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad she didn't do that.,chit-chat
accordingly he took off his boots and crept upstairs in his stockinged feet whilst mrs moyle having put out the lamp and ascertained that the door of the cottage was securely fastened returned to salome whom she found sleeping peacefully,novel
i'm so sorry you had to go through that. i hope you're okay.,chit-chat
the next day josiah put himself in the way of silas moyle and actually apologised to him for having struck,novel
that's so sad. i'm glad he didn't do that to him.,chit-chat
and silas was magnanimous and forgave him though it must be admitted he regarded the others black eye and swelled cheek with a sense of satisfaction,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think of it that way. i wonder what silas's motivation was.,chit-chat
they were marks that would remain to remind josiah of his ill conduct for some days to come,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i've never heard of josiah's ill conduct before.,chit-chat
salome was poorly for nearly a week and the first occasion on which she showed herself in the village she was met on all sides by commiserating looks and words which showed her plainly that everyone was quite aware that her father had been the cause of her accident,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope she's okay. what happened?,chit-chat
the sympathy thus evinced towards her though kindly offered cut her to the heart and she returned home utterly miserable,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
during the days which followed mr amyatt made several ineffectual attempts to induce josiah to take the pledge,novel
"oh my god, that's terrible! i'm so sorry to hear that. what happened?",chit-chat
no josiah said there was no need for him to do that but he had made up his mind to turn over a new leaf nevertheless and the vicar would see that he could take his glass of beer like other men and be none the worse for it,novel
"i don't know what josiah's deal is, but i'm glad he didn't do it.",chit-chat
the vicar shook his head at that but josiah was not to be moved so the matter was perforce dropped,novel
i didn't realize josiah wasn't moved. that's a bummer.,chit-chat
margaret was the first of the inmates of greystone to hear of salomes accident,novel
"i've never heard of salomes accident, but i'm familiar with it. what's it about?",chit-chat
mrs moyle gave her full particulars of it one morning when she had an errand at the shop,novel
that's so nice of mrs moyle to do that. what did she do with it?,chit-chat
and before going home she went to inquire for her lame friend whom she found sitting in the porch of the cottage with such a bright hopeful expression on her pale countenance that she was surprised and remarked upon it,novel
that's really sweet of her. i'm sure she was very happy for you.,chit-chat
oh i am ever so much better,novel
that's great to hear! i'm glad you're feeling better. what's going on?,chit-chat
salome assured her with a smile,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i think i'll do that.,chit-chat
are you really,novel
"yes, i am. i've been trying to figure out what to do with my life.",chit-chat
margaret asked anxiously,novel
i've never heard of margaret asked anxieties before. what did she say?,chit-chat
you have a nasty bruise on your forehead,novel
"yeah, it's pretty bad. i'm going to have to get it checked out.",chit-chat
oh thats nothing indeed miss,novel
"i know, i was so happy to be able to go home and have a good time.",chit-chat
have you heard how it happened,novel
"no, i don't think i have. i'm not sure what i did.",chit-chat
they havent made you believe father did it on purpose have they,novel
i don't think so. i'm not sure if he did it on purpose or not.,chit-chat
he wouldnt hurt me for anything if he could help it,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did he do to make you feel that way?,chit-chat
oh miss margaret i do believe father means to be steadier for the future,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he's gone.,chit-chat
is he going to be a teetotaler then,novel
"yes, he is going to be a teetotaler. i am so proud of him.",chit-chat
margaret inquired eagerly,novel
margaret margaret is one of my favorite authors. do you like margaret margaret? she's my favorite author.,chit-chat
noo was the dubious reply im afraid not but he says he wont take more beer than is good for him,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's able to get over it.,chit-chat
oh i know he has said that lots of times before but i believe he really means it now,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he means it now.,chit-chat
indeed he has been quite different these last few daysmore like what he used to be when dear mother was alive,novel
i'm so sorry to hear about dear mother. i hope she's doing better now.,chit-chat
this was quite true,novel
i'm glad to hear that. it's always nice to have someone to talk to.,chit-chat
mrs moyles words that he would have to choose between drink and salome had made a strong impression upon josiah and had caused him to notice how much thinner and paler his little daughter had become of late,novel
i've never heard of mrs moyles. what does she say about josiah?,chit-chat
his conscience reproached him on her account for he knew that she was not very strong and that she worked hard besides which his unsteady habits were a constant trouble to her,novel
i can't imagine how hard it must have been for him to have to work so hard.,chit-chat
in his repentance he felt capable of denying himself anything for her sakeexcept drink and that he solemnly vowed he would take sparingly,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he's doing better now.,chit-chat
seeing that salome was so hopeful that her father meant to live a sober life for the future margaret had not the heart to express the doubts which occupied her mind but on her return to greystone she saw by mr fowlers grave face when she explained the situation to him that he did not believe josiahs repentance would be lasting and trembled for the safety and happiness of her little lame friend,novel
i'm so sorry that happened to you. i hope you're doing better now.,chit-chat
dont you think he means to keep his word and not get intoxicated again,novel
i don't think so. i think he just doesn't want to admit he was wrong.,chit-chat
she questioned,novel
what do you mean by that? i'm not sure what you're talking about.,chit-chat
oh yes,novel
i'm so glad i got to see it. it's been a long time since i've seen it.,chit-chat
mr fowler replied i think he means all he says,novel
i think you're right. i'm not sure what he's talking about.,chit-chat
but i feel sure if he does not give up drink altogether it will soon have the mastery over him again,novel
that's a good point. i'm sure he'll get over it though.,chit-chat
i believe he loves salome very dearly but he loves drink even better than his little daughter or he would be willing to give it up for her sake,novel
i don't think he would give it up for her sake. i'm sure she'll love it.,chit-chat
poor salome,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're doing better than you think.,chit-chat
i greatly fear she has more trouble in store for her with that father of hers,novel
i don't think so. i think she'll be fine. she's a good person.,chit-chat
this proved to be the case,novel
what did it prove to be the case? i'm not sure what you mean by that.,chit-chat
for before a fortnight had quite elapsed since salomes accident josiah was drinking heavily again and spending his evenings at the crab and cockle as he had done of old,novel
i'm so sorry to hear about your accident. i hope you're feeling better now.,chit-chat
his repentance had been of brief duration and the lame girls face grew pinched and her dark brown eyes larger and sadder as her father squandered more and more of his earnings at the village inn whilst silas moyle grumbled when the pethericks bread account remained unpaid and would have stopped the supply but for salome,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i've never heard of his repentance before.",chit-chat
the poor little maid looks halfstarved as it is he remarked to his wife when she expressed surprise that he took no steps to obtain his rights,novel
i'm not sure what you're talking about. are you talking about the maid?,chit-chat
josiahs drinking what ought to be spent on his child but it shall never be said that we begrudged her bread,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. it's always good to give back to the community.,chit-chat
chapter xiii,novel
i've been reading a lot of chapter 13 lately. it's my favorite book of all time.,chit-chat
mrs fowler and salome,novel
"have you heard of mrs. salome? she's an american singer, songwriter, and actress.",chit-chat
when mrs lute returned to n she asked and obtained permission for margaret to visit her,novel
"i've never seen the movie, but i hear it's really good. did you like it?",chit-chat
the little girl had not appeared very well lately and it was thought a change would do her good which it certainly did for she came back at the end of a fortnight decidedly better in health and spirits,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope she's doing better now. how old is she?,chit-chat
mrs fowler greeted margaret on her return with no very great show of pleasure though secretly she was delighted to see her looking so well,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you had a great time with her.,chit-chat
she never told her how glad she was to have her at home again or that she had missed her as she had actually done,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. it's a shame that she didn't tell you how glad she was to have her at home again.,chit-chat
and consequently margaret was not a little disappointed and the kiss she gave her governess was far warmer than the one she imprinted on her mothers fair cheeka fact mrs fowler did not fail to notice,novel
that's good to hear. i'm glad she didn't fail to notice.,chit-chat
i have forfeited her respect and affection thought the mother bitterly,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did she do to make you feel that way?,chit-chat
she does not care for me she never did thought the child,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. do you think you'll be able to talk to her about it?,chit-chat
so the estrangement between the two grew till it was patent to everybody,novel
"yes, that's what i was thinking. it's crazy to think that they have been together for so long.",chit-chat
perhaps mr fowler and the governess guessed the cause of it but the servants blamed their mistress and declared she was so wrapped up in master gerald that she had no love to spare for her daughter,novel
that's a good theory. i'm not sure if it's true though.,chit-chat
on her return to greystone margaret resumed her organ lessons but she was obliged to practise in the afternoons now as the evenings were dark,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope she's doing better now. what happened to her?,chit-chat
the golden touch of autumn was upon everything the orchards were being cleared of their fruit and the village children scoured the country around yelton for blackberries and sloes and mushrooms,novel
the golden touch of autumn was upon everything the orchards were being cleared of their fruit and the village children scoured the country around yelton for blackberries and sloes and mushrooms,chit-chat
at the end of september the fine weather broke up and was followed by the equinoctial gales which did great damage in the greystone gardens the fierce wind tearing up shrubs by the roots and the heavy rains beating down the summer flowers which had lingered late in bloom,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. that must have been devastating. i hope you're ok.,chit-chat
mr fowler braved the fury of the elements and was out of doors every day but the weather was too rough for the other inmates of greystone who remained in the house till the gales had passed,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope greystone is doing better now.,chit-chat
thus it was that margaret and salome did not see as much of each other as they had done hitherto,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i didn't think of that.,chit-chat

after supper he went to bed at his usual time and forgetful of the rising storm and the prospect of a wreck was soon asleep,novel
oh no! that must have been so scary! did you have to go to the hospital?,chit-chat
miss conway and margaret sat up till ten oclock alternately talking and listening to the wind which was now howling dolefully around the house almost driving in the windowpanes and mingling its sobs and wails with the angry roar of the sea and then they too retired to their respective rooms,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get some sleep.,chit-chat
the gale increased in fury however and then came the rain,novel

i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're ok. i've never been to yelton.,chit-chat

i'm so sorry to hear that. it must have been so hard for you and your family.,chit-chat
in the pethericks cottage salome stood by the kitchen window listening to the storm and patiently waiting for her father,novel

for the time she had forgotten how troublous was her life as her soul rose on the wings of faith to an altitude which set her far above the trials of this world,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. how long did it take for her to forget about it?,chit-chat
she sang the hymn from beginning to end in a soft undertone with the wailing wind for an accompanyment then opening the window she thrust out her head and listened,novel

she heard hurrying footsteps passing the cottage and mens hoarse voices shouting,novel

i hope nothing is wrong she thought as she received no answer but i suppose they are obliged to shout to make themselves heard,novel
that's what i'm thinking too. i don't know what to do.,chit-chat
she tried in vain to pierce the darkness,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you referring to something i've never heard of before?,chit-chat
if a vessel had been in distress the crew would fire guns or send up rockets she reflected,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of that before. do you have a source?,chit-chat
the rain beat against her face so she drew back from the window which she shut and turned her attention to the fire remembering that her father would certainly return drenched to the skin,novel
that's really sweet of her. i'm glad she was able to remember that.,chit-chat
suddenly the cottage door was flung open and margaret fowler hatless and with her fair hair hanging around her face stood before her,novel
"hey margaret, how are you doing today? i just got back from the cottage door myself.",chit-chat
oh salome,novel

"wow, that must have been scary. did you have to go to the hospital or anything?",chit-chat
he had dressed and we believe he must have gone out,novel
why did you think he had gone out? did you find out who he was before he left?,chit-chat
perhaps he is somewhere hiding in the house salome suggested,novel
that's a good idea. i'll try to find him and see if i can find him.,chit-chat
surely he would not go out on a night like this,novel
i don't know... i'm not sure what to do about it.,chit-chat
yes i think he would,novel
i don't know. i'm not sure if he's going to do it or not.,chit-chat

i'm sure he is. i've seen him at the beach a few times.,chit-chat
if he is father will be sure to notice him and take care of him salome said consolingly,novel

i don't think so. i think i'm going to have a heart attack.,chit-chat
if he does it will kill mother,novel
that's what i'm worried about. i don't know what to do.,chit-chat
margaret cried despairingly,novel
"i'm sorry to hear that. what did margaret cry about, if you don't mind me asking?",chit-chat
she loves him so dearly,novel
that's so sweet of her. i'm sure she's very proud of him.,chit-chat
no i mustnt stay i must go and find gerald if i can and opening the door she rushed away into the darkness again,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find him soon.,chit-chat
after a few minutes of indecision salome put on her jacket tied a shawl around her head and leaving the cottage door unlocked hastened towards the beach,novel
"wow, that must have been a long time ago. did you find out who did it?",chit-chat
she had not gone far however before she came upon a group of fishermen one of whom was her father,novel
"wow, that must have been a long time ago. how long did it take you to find her?",chit-chat
she explained that the little boy from greystone was missing from his home but no one had seen him,novel
that's terrible. i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's okay.,chit-chat
her father was vexed that she had ventured out in such a storm and peremptorily ordered her to return,novel
that's terrible. i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope she's okay.,chit-chat
ill look around an see if i can find master gerald he said,novel

it was margaret who spoke,novel
that's interesting. did you find out who it was? i've never heard of margaret who spoke before.,chit-chat
she had been led in the direction of the group by the sound of voices and clutched josiah by the arm to steady herself as a fierce gust of wind nearly took her off her feet,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope she's okay. what did she do?,chit-chat
do you go back with salome miss he said,novel

margaret replied earnestly,novel
"have you heard of margaret margaret? she's an american singer, songwriter, and actress.",chit-chat
she was really nearly done up with battling against the wind and the rain so she raised no objection to returning with salome,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad she was able to get back in shape.,chit-chat
the little girls reached the cottage in safety and upon entering found miss conway in the kitchen,novel
that must have been a scary experience for the little girls. did they have a good time?,chit-chat
having knocked in vain at the door she had tried to open it and finding it unlocked had gone in she too had thought it possible that gerald might be there,novel
"oh my gosh, that's terrible! i'm so sorry that happened to you.",chit-chat
if hes on the beach father will find him you may depend upon that salome assured her,novel
that's a good idea. i'm not sure if i can trust her though.,chit-chat
and he will bring him straight here,novel
i hope so. it's been a long time since i've seen him play.,chit-chat
i fear you will both catch dreadful colds and she glanced commiseratingly from margaret to the governess,novel
that's what i'm worried about. i don't know what to do.,chit-chat
we shant mind that so long as gerald is safe margaret returned,novel
"i know, i was so happy when he came back. i can't wait to see him again.",chit-chat
she was shivering and her teeth were chattering as much with fright on her brothers account as with cold,novel
"oh no, i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope she's okay.",chit-chat
oh miss conway what shall we do if anything has happened to him,novel
i don't know. i'm not sure what to do. i hope he's okay.,chit-chat
mother will never forgive us if dear margaret dont be morbid neither you nor i have been to blame miss conway reminded her,novel

if harm has come to your brother it has been through no fault of ours,novel
that's good to hear. i don't know if i can trust him anymore.,chit-chat
who would imagine that he would deliberately get up and dress and steal out of the house unknown to anyone,novel
i don't think i would have been able to do that. i'm glad he didn't.,chit-chat
whatever the result of this mad freak of his proves to be will have been his own doing,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you referring to the fact that he lost his job?,chit-chat
it is terrible to think what may have happened to him,novel
"i know, it's so sad. i don't know what happened to him.",chit-chat
the wind is high enough to blow him into the sea if he is really on the beach,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think of that. i'm glad he's safe.,chit-chat
oh mother will hate the sight of me for ever if gerald is drowned,novel

for once gerald had gone too far as he discovered on the following day when for punishment his governess insisted on keeping him locked up in his bedroom,novel
what did gerald do to get locked up in his bedroom? what did he do to deserve it?,chit-chat

i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
a more salutary mode of punishment could not have been devised and in consequence gerald appeared at the breakfasttable on the morning following his imprisonment in a subdued and repentant frame of mind,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. what did gerald do to deserve that punishment? did he get caught?,chit-chat
he said he was sorry for his past conduct but he could not extract a promise from either miss conway or margaret that his father should not be informed of the anxiety and trouble he had caused the whole household,novel

margaret could eat no breakfast but she took a few sips of the milk ross brought her a short while later and afterwards fell into an uneasy sleep,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope she's okay. what happened to margaret?,chit-chat
the maid moving about softly lit the fire and dusted the room then turned her attention to the flushed face on the pillow,novel
"oh my god, that's so gross! i'm so sorry to hear that.",chit-chat

i don't think she's going to be. i'm sure she'll be fine though.,chit-chat
i wonder if the mistress would trouble much,novel
i don't think so. i'm sure she's used to it by now.,chit-chat
roes moved away to the fireplace and taking up some sewingwork stitched industriously every now and again glancing towards the restless sleeper,novel
oh no! i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
suddenly the little girl uttered a shriek and sprang up in bed whereupon ross dropped her work and hastened to the bedside,novel
"oh my god, i can't believe you've done this. what did you do?",chit-chat
what is it dear,novel
"i'm not sure what it is, but i can't stop thinking about it.",chit-chat

margarets blue eyes wide open were fixed upon ross face but she evidently had not followed what the woman had said for after a short silence she began to mutter distressfully about gerald again,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
ross was now exceedingly alarmed,novel
i can't wait to see what he's going to come up with next week.,chit-chat
she rang the bell and sent for miss conway who in her turn tried to pacify the sick child,novel
"oh wow, that's terrible. i'm sorry to hear that. what did she do?",chit-chat
but margaret paid no more attention to her governess than she had to ross,novel

he was somewhat frightened when told margaret was ill but in obedience to miss conway he stooped over the bed to kiss her,novel
"oh my god, that's so gross! i'm so sorry to hear that.",chit-chat
