"i've never heard of that, but i'm sure it's a good idea.",chit-chat
if it be a matter of great consequence there may be a comittee of the whole house which is only thus ye speaker leaves his chaire and they resolve themselves into such a committee and debate matters and for that tyme choose a chairman for the committee,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure i'd want to be in that situation.,chit-chat
then the speaker reasumes the chaire and this chaireman of ye comittee reports the debate of yt committee to the speaker and whole house,novel

these prorogations allwayes puts an end to all debates and all bills which are not ffinished and brought the king to pass so that at their meeteing againe they must begin the things they would have or were about the last tyme anew,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to make it to the meetup.,chit-chat
this prorogation is in the kings power and is often done for ten dayes only to put a stop to heares and debates in the houses and also to put an end to something that is not likd by ye government,novel

these things are so well adjusted and so for the common good that if rightly maintaind in their proper places would be a happy constitution,novel
i agree. it's hard to believe that there are still so many people who don't know what they're doing.,chit-chat
all acts of parliament so passd are printed but ye records of them are kept in the journalls of ye parliament by the clerke of ye parliament,novel
that's interesting. i didn't know that. do you have a source for that information?,chit-chat

every free man of england being oppressd comes in due form of law to demand his right which being heard by the judges and a jury of his own fellow subjectshis country menthey give their verdict in the matter as they thinke most just according to the statutes and laws and so the right between man and man which does vary from ye different customs of each county or precinct,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i didn't know that. thank you for sharing that information with me.",chit-chat
this jury are twelve men all sworne on the bible solemnly to do justice not out of feare fraud or malice favour or affection to jnjure any man and ye first man is their foreman and speakes for the rest either acquit or condemns the person wch is in life or death so determining other causes the same manner and these twelve men must all be agreed in their verdict which is after they have heard all can be witnessd or alleadged on all sides wch verdict the judges also must pronounce on ye causes as they have brought it in,novel
"wow, that's a lot of people. i'm not sure i could handle that.",chit-chat
now those suites of law as well as causes of life and death are brought in by bill to ye grandjury which are twenty four and these all of the best gentry and many of them justices of peace they examine the matter and if they find it that is by any act of parliament is pleadable or to be enquired into they draw it up into an jndictmt and so its sent into the court to be tryed by the petty jury after whose verdict and the judges pronouncing it the matter must be at an end and taken out of that court,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i've never heard of a jndictmt before.",chit-chat
sometymes indeed if the subject is oppressd he may appeale to another court yts higher as from the sessions to the assizes thence to the kings bench thence to ye chancery or the parliament house which when a matter has there been debated and decided there can be noe more done in it because they are the makers of the laws so best able to interpret,novel
"i'm not sure i follow. what do you mean by "" sometymes ""?",chit-chat
sometymes in these other courts a jury brings in a matter speciall that is leaves it on the judges to determine being a matter of law then ye judges must consult and do it all of them together,novel
that's a good way of looking at it. i've never been on a jury before.,chit-chat
all persons are tryed by those of their own ranke a commoner of england is tryed by a jury of commoners in all cases and of life and death a peer of england is tryed by his peers and in case it is not the tyme of ye parliament sitting then by a bill of oyer and terminer issued out there is 12 peers are jmpannelld as a jury,novel
"wow, that's a lot of people. i'm not sure i've ever heard of jmpannelld before.",chit-chat
but i must mention one thing as to the petty juryes of commoners a person which is tryed for his life may challenge some of those wch are brought to be sworne for his jury that is except against them to such a number without giving reason but if he exceeds that number he must give reason for such exception either to be a man he had injured or one wch had former malice or one related to ye persons who either is dead or injured for our laws condemn to death murther fellony treasons,novel
"that's a good point. i've never thought about it like that before, but it makes sense.",chit-chat
by this order you see its justice and care,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad you think so.,chit-chat
then in matters of life and death the witness for the king are sworne but ye witness for the prisoners are not sworne but only examined to declare the truth,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm not sure i agree with that.,chit-chat
but to returne to the tryals of a peer which by such a jury is tryed in case the house of lords ye parliament is sitting then they prepare westminster hall for the tryal the house of comons manage the evidence and prosecute them and the house of lords are the judges and jury in this manner if it be for life or death wch is grounded on a statute either against murther treason or fellony and so ye arraignment is read and ye councill for both sides,novel
i'm not sure what you're trying to say. are you trying to tell me that the house of lords is the judges and jury in this manner if it be for life or death wch is grounded on a statute either against murther treason or fellony and so ye arraignment is read and ye councill for both sides?,chit-chat
ye house of commons produces their evidence and witness and the king constitutes a lord high steward for that day or in case the tryal be long he must be continued till the tryall finishes,novel

he beares a white staff as badge of his great office which indeed is ye greatest officer in england and for the tyme can act for the king so above him,novel
"i've never heard of him, but i'm sure he's a great officer.",chit-chat
he is usually the person that is lord chancellor if he be a peer which allwayes is,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think of that. i'll have to look into that.,chit-chat
there he sitts as judge to whome the other peeres of the whole house of lords are joynd and after a full examination on both sides and the criminall haveing had full leave to cleer himself then the lord high steward askes ye lords one by one beginning with the puny lord so to the highest in honour my lord such a one do you thinke my lord that the prisoner at the barre is guilty or not guiltyto which each lord stands up and answeres for himself either so as he judges guilty upon my honour or else not guilty upon my honour and so it goes from one to all in this manner the lord high steward marks down to each lords name his answere and at the last reckons them up so many guiltyes so many not guiltyes then he adds his own thoughts to the side he thinks best but usualy he is so crafty as to add to the side of the majority which being done he pronounces the verdict as ye majority said either guilty or not,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. i've never read a book like that before.",chit-chat
now this verdict the lords give thus on their honour is equivalent to the oath the commoners take that serve in juryes for ye peeres take no oath in these matters otherwise than so,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm not sure i agree with that.,chit-chat
now in case ye matter against a peer be only a law matter of nuiseprise then the matter being debated and the answere by ye lord made in his deffence read and councell pleading then ye lord high steward askes each lord in same order as before but in this forme in ye matter which has been debated before yr lord concerning the lord at the barre wth his deffence whether his deffence be sufficient to cleer him or not what sayes yr lordships content or not content on yr honour they all answer as they are affected or understand ye matter content or else not content which are fixed to each name and so reckond up and ye majority carrys it either to quitt or not to quitt him to which the lord high steward adds his as he pleases also after which they shew the high steward a respect as a king,novel
"i'm not sure what you're trying to say, but i don't get it.",chit-chat
he is servd on the knee and drinkes some wine and when that is done he breakes his white staff and so pulls off his hatt,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm sure he's proud of you for doing that.,chit-chat
when he was the high steward he had all the maces carryd before him all ye officers attending,novel
"wow, that must have been a lot of work. did you get to see him again?",chit-chat
but in case there be no chancellour only a lord keeper as at present is which is no peer of ye realme then he has no vote with ye lords only count up ye votes and declares them wch has the majority without the addition of his haveing none and he is only substituted the deputy steward for the day and so sitts but on a wool sack as he does in the house of lords and is only their speaker and officer and must aske leave for himself and the judges to put on their caps before they might do it now the high steward sitts in the throne of justice under a cannopy but i see this lord keeper only sate on a wool sack at the foote of the throne which stood empty behind him,novel
"wow, that's a lot of work. i'm not sure i could do it.",chit-chat
he had noe compliment paid him more than at another tyme being only as the speaker to ye house of lords and so their officer,novel
