title a modest proposal author jonathan swift release date october 1 1997 ebook 1080 most recently updated march 10 2021 language english start of the project gutenberg ebook a modest proposal a modest proposal for preventing the children of poor people in ireland from being a burden on their parents or country and for making them beneficial to the publick,novel
"wow, that's a long time. i've never heard of gutenberg. what's the name of the project?",chit-chat
by dr jonathan swift 1729 it is a melancholy object to those who walk through this great town or travel in the country when they see the streets the roads and cabbindoors crowded with beggars of the female sex followed by three four or six children all in rags and importuning every passenger for an alms,novel
i love dr. jonathan swift 1729 it is a melancholy object to those who walk through this great town or travel in the country when they see the streets the roads and cabbindoors crowded with beggars of the female sex followed by three four or six children all in rags and importuning every passenger for a alms,chit-chat
these mothers instead of being able to work for their honest livelihood are forced to employ all their time in stroling to beg sustenance for their helpless infants who as they grow up either turn thieves for want of work or leave their dear native country to fight for the pretender in spain or sell themselves to the barbadoes,novel
i don't know why you're being downvoted. i agree with you 100 %.,chit-chat
i think it is agreed by all parties that this prodigious number of children in the arms or on the backs or at the heels of their mothers and frequently of their fathers is in the present deplorable state of the kingdom a very great additional grievance and therefore whoever could find out a fair cheap and easy method of making these children sound and useful members of the commonwealth would deserve so well of the publick as to have his statue set up for a preserver of the nation,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'd rather have a statue set up for a preserver of the nation.",chit-chat
but my intention is very far from being confined to provide only for the children of professed beggars it is of a much greater extent and shall take in the whole number of infants at a certain age who are born of parents in effect as little able to support them as those who demand our charity in the streets,novel
that's very noble of you. i'm sure you'll find a way to make it happen.,chit-chat
as to my own part having turned my thoughts for many years upon this important subject and maturely weighed the several schemes of our projectors i have always found them grossly mistaken in their computation,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
it is true a child just dropt from its dam may be supported by her milk for a solar year with little other nourishment at most not above the value of two shillings which the mother may certainly get or the value in scraps by her lawful occupation of begging and it is exactly at one year old that i propose to provide for them in such a manner as instead of being a charge upon their parents or the parish or wanting food and raiment for the rest of their lives they shall on the contrary contribute to the feeding and partly to the clothing of many thousands,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm not sure i'd agree with that.,chit-chat
there is likewise another great advantage in my scheme that it will prevent those voluntary abortions and that horrid practice of women murdering their bastard children alas,novel
that's a good point. i don't think i've ever heard of that practice.,chit-chat
too frequent among us sacrificing the poor innocent babes i doubt more to avoid the expence than the shame which would move tears and pity in the most savage and inhuman breast,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure i'd want to do that.,chit-chat
the number of souls in this kingdom being usually reckoned one million and a half of these i calculate there may be about two hundred thousand couple whose wives are breeders from which number i subtract thirty thousand couple who are able to maintain their own children although i apprehend there can not be so many under the present distresses of the kingdom but this being granted there will remain a hundred and seventy thousand breeders,novel
"wow, that's a lot of people. do you have any idea how many people are in this kingdom?",chit-chat
i again subtract fifty thousand for those women who miscarry or whose children die by accident or disease within the year,novel
that's a lot of money. i'm glad you're doing something about it.,chit-chat
there only remain a hundred and twenty thousand children of poor parents annually born,novel
"wow, that's a lot of children. do you have a source for that number?",chit-chat
the question therefore is how this number shall be reared and provided for,novel
"i'm not sure, but i think it's going to be a lot higher than i thought it would be.",chit-chat
which as i have already said under the present situation of affairs is utterly impossible by all the methods hitherto proposed,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to work things out.,chit-chat
for we can neither employ them in handicraft or agriculture they neither build houses i mean in the country nor cultivate land they can very seldom pick up a livelihood by stealing till they arrive at six years old except where they are of towardly parts although i confess they learn the rudiments much earlier during which time they can however be properly looked upon only as probationers as i have been informed by a principal gentleman in the county of cavan who protested to me that he never knew above one or two instances under the age of six even in a part of the kingdom so renowned for the quickest proficiency in that art,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of a cavan gentleman before. what is his name?,chit-chat
i am assured by our merchants that a boy or a girl before twelve years old is no saleable commodity and even when they come to this age they will not yield above three pounds or three pounds and half a crown at most on the exchange which can not turn to account either to the parents or kingdom the charge of nutriments and rags having been at least four times that value,novel
that's a good attitude to have. i don't think i could do that.,chit-chat
i shall now therefore humbly propose my own thoughts which i hope will not be liable to the least objection,novel
that's great! i'm sure you're going to have a great time!,chit-chat
i have been assured by a very knowing american of my acquaintance in london that a young healthy child well nursed is at a year old a most delicious nourishing and wholesome food whether stewed roasted baked or boiled and i make no doubt that it will equally serve in a fricasee or a ragoust,novel
"wow, that's amazing! i've never heard of a fricasee before.",chit-chat
i do therefore humbly offer it to publick consideration that of the hundred and twenty thousand children already computed twenty thousand may be reserved for breed whereof only one fourth part to be males which is more than we allow to sheep black cattle or swine and my reason is that these children are seldom the fruits of marriage a circumstance not much regarded by our savages therefore one male will be sufficient to serve four females,novel
"wow, that's a lot of children. i'm not sure i could handle that many.",chit-chat
that the remaining hundred thousand may at a year old be offered in sale to the persons of quality and fortune through the kingdom always advising the mother to let them suck plentifully in the last month so as to render them plump and fat for a good table,novel
"wow, that's a lot of money. i've never heard of that before.",chit-chat
a child will make two dishes at an entertainment for friends and when the family dines alone the fore or hind quarter will make a reasonable dish and seasoned with a little pepper or salt will be very good boiled on the fourth day especially in winter,novel
that's a great idea! i'll have to try that. do you have a favorite dish?,chit-chat
i have reckoned upon a medium that a child just born will weigh 12 pounds and in a solar year if tolerably nursed encreaseth to 28 pounds,novel
"wow, that's a lot of weight. i'm not sure i could handle that.",chit-chat
i grant this food will be somewhat dear and therefore very proper for landlords who as they have already devoured most of the parents seem to have the best title to the children,novel
that's good to hear. i'm sure they'll be happy to hear that.,chit-chat
infants flesh will be in season throughout the year but more plentiful in march and a little before and after for we are told by a grave author an eminent french physician that fish being a prolifick dyet there are more children born in roman catholick countries about nine months after lent than at any other season therefore reckoning a year after lent the markets will be more glutted than usual because the number of popish infants is at least three to one in this kingdom and therefore it will have one other collateral advantage by lessening the number of papists among us,novel
"wow, that's interesting. do you have a source for the number of popish infants?",chit-chat
i have already computed the charge of nursing a beggars child in which list i reckon all cottagers labourers and fourfifths of the farmers to be about two shillings per annum rags included and i believe no gentleman would repine to give ten shillings for the carcass of a good fat child which as i have said will make four dishes of excellent nutritive meat when he hath only some particular friend or his own family to dine with him,novel
"wow, that's a lot of food for a beginner. i'm not sure i could do that.",chit-chat
thus the squire will learn to be a good landlord and grow popular among his tenants the mother will have eight shillings neat profit and be fit for work till she produces another child,novel
"wow, that's a lot of money. i'm not sure i could do that.",chit-chat
those who are more thrifty as i must confess the times require may flay the carcass the skin of which artificially dressed will make admirable gloves for ladies and summer boots for fine gentlemen,novel
that's a great idea! i'll have to try that. i've never thought of that before.,chit-chat
as to our city of dublin shambles may be appointed for this purpose in the most convenient parts of it and butchers we may be assured will not be wanting although i rather recommend buying the children alive and dressing them hot from the knife as we do roasting pigs,novel
i'm not familiar with dublin shambles. what is it like there? i've never heard of it before.,chit-chat
a very worthy person a true lover of his country and whose virtues i highly esteem was lately pleased in discoursing on this matter to offer a refinement upon my scheme,novel
that's very nice of you. i'm sure he's a great person.,chit-chat
he said that many gentlemen of this kingdom having of late destroyed their deer he conceived that the want of venison might be well supplied by the bodies of young lads and maidens not exceeding fourteen years of age nor under twelve so great a number of both sexes in every county being now ready to starve for want of work and service and these to be disposed of by their parents if alive or otherwise by their nearest relations,novel
"wow, that's so sad. i'm sorry to hear that. what happened?",chit-chat
but with due deference to so excellent a friend and so deserving a patriot i can not be altogether in his sentiments for as to the males my american acquaintance assured me from frequent experience that their flesh was generally tough and lean like that of our schoolboys by continual exercise and their taste disagreeable and to fatten them would not answer the charge,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
then as to the females it would i think with humble submission be a loss to the publick because they soon would become breeders themselves and besides it is not improbable that some scrupulous people might be apt to censure such a practice although indeed very unjustly as a little bordering upon cruelty which i confess hath always been with me the strongest objection against any project how well soever intended,novel
i don't think i've ever heard of humble submission before. what's it about?,chit-chat
but in order to justify my friend he confessed that this expedient was put into his head by the famous psalmanaazor a native of the island formosa who came from thence to london above twenty years ago and in conversation told my friend that in his country when any young person happened to be put to death the executioner sold the carcass to persons of quality as a prime dainty and that in his time the body of a plump girl of fifteen who was crucified for an attempt to poison the emperor was sold to his imperial majestys prime minister of state and other great mandarins of the court in joints from the gibbet at four hundred crowns,novel
"wow, that's crazy. i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's ok.",chit-chat
neither indeed can i deny that if the same use were made of several plump young girls in this town who without one single groat to their fortunes can not stir abroad without a chair and appear at a playhouse and assemblies in foreign fineries which they never will pay for the kingdom would not be the worse,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not sure i'd want to live in a town full of plumbers.",chit-chat
some persons of a desponding spirit are in great concern about that vast number of poor people who are aged diseased or maimed and i have been desired to employ my thoughts what course may be taken to ease the nation of so grievous an incumbrance,novel
i don't think i've ever heard of anyone in a desponding spirit who is in great concern about that vast number of poor people who are aged diseased or maimed and i have been desired to employ my thoughts what course may be taken to ease the nation of so grievous an incumbrance,chit-chat
but i am not in the least pain upon that matter because it is very well known that they are every day dying and rotting by cold and famine and filth and vermin as fast as can be reasonably expected,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're not in the least pain.,chit-chat
and as to the young labourers they are now in almost as hopeful a condition,novel
that's good to hear. i'm glad to hear they're getting better.,chit-chat
they can not get work and consequently pine away from want of nourishment to a degree that if at any time they are accidentally hired to common labour they have not strength to perform it and thus the country and themselves are happily delivered from the evils to come,novel
i don't know why you're being downvoted. it's very true.,chit-chat
i have too long digressed and therefore shall return to my subject,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what subject did you have to digress from?,chit-chat
i think the advantages by the proposal which i have made are obvious and many as well as of the highest importance,novel
that's good to hear. i'm sure you've done a great job.,chit-chat
for first as i have already observed it would greatly lessen the number of papists with whom we are yearly overrun being the principal breeders of the nation as well as our most dangerous enemies and who stay at home on purpose with a design to deliver the kingdom to the pretender hoping to take their advantage by the absence of so many good protestants who have chosen rather to leave their country than stay at home and pay tithes against their conscience to an episcopal curate,novel
i don't think i've ever heard of an episcopal curate. what is that?,chit-chat
secondly the poorer tenants will have something valuable of their own which by law may be made liable to a distress and help to pay their landlords rent their corn and cattle being already seized and money a thing unknown,novel
"that's a good point, i didn't think of that. do you think it's worth it?",chit-chat
thirdly whereas the maintainance of a hundred thousand children from two years old and upwards can not be computed at less than ten shillings a piece per annum the nations stock will be thereby encreased fifty thousand pounds per annum besides the profit of a new dish introduced to the tables of all gentlemen of fortune in the kingdom who have any refinement in taste,novel
"wow, that's a lot of money. i'm not sure i could afford that.",chit-chat
and the money will circulate among our selves the goods being entirely of our own growth and manufacture,novel
"i'm not sure what you mean by that, but i hope you're right.",chit-chat
fourthly the constant breeders besides the gain of eight shillings sterling per annum by the sale of their children will be rid of the charge of maintaining them after the first year,novel
"wow, that's a lot of kids. do you have any idea how much that would cost?",chit-chat
fifthly this food would likewise bring great custom to taverns where the vintners will certainly be so prudent as to procure the best receipts for dressing it to perfection and consequently have their houses frequented by all the fine gentlemen who justly value themselves upon their knowledge in good eating and a skilful cook who understands how to oblige his guests will contrive to make it as expensive as they please,novel
"i've never been to a taverns, but i'd love to go one day.",chit-chat
sixthly this would be a great inducement to marriage which all wise nations have either encouraged by rewards or enforced by laws and penalties,novel
"i agree, it would be a great inducement to marriage which all wise nations have either encouraged by rewards or enforced by laws and penalty",chit-chat
it would encrease the care and tenderness of mothers towards their children when they were sure of a settlement for life to the poor babes provided in some sort by the publick to their annual profit instead of expence,novel
"that's a good point. i'm not sure if i agree with that, but it's good to think about it.",chit-chat
we should soon see an honest emulation among the married women which of them could bring the fattest child to the market,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure i'd want to be that fat.,chit-chat
men would become as fond of their wives during the time of their pregnancy as they are now of their mares in foal their cows in calf or sows when they are ready to farrow nor offer to beat or kick them as is too frequent a practice for fear of a miscarriage,novel
i'm not sure i follow. are you saying men would become as fond of their wives during the time of their pregnancy as they are now of their mares in foal their cows in calf or sows when they are ready to farrow or kick them as is too frequent a practice for fear of a miscarriage?,chit-chat
many other advantages might be enumerated,novel
"that's true, but i'm not sure if it's a good thing or not.",chit-chat
for instance the addition of some thousand carcasses in our exportation of barreld beef the propagation of swines flesh and improvement in the art of making good bacon so much wanted among us by the great destruction of pigs too frequent at our tables which are no way comparable in taste or magnificence to a well grown fat yearling child which roasted whole will make a considerable figure at a lord mayors feast or any other publick entertainment,novel
i've never heard of a lord mayors's feast before. what is it about?,chit-chat
but this and many others i omit being studious of brevity,novel
"i'm sorry to hear that. what do you do for a living, if you don't mind me asking?",chit-chat
supposing that one thousand families in this city would be constant customers for infants flesh besides others who might have it at merry meetings particularly at weddings and christenings i compute that dublin would take off annually about twenty thousand carcasses and the rest of the kingdom where probably they will be sold somewhat cheaper the remaining eighty thousand,novel
"wow, that's a lot of families. do you have any idea how many families there are?",chit-chat
i can think of no one objection that will possibly be raised against this proposal unless it should be urged that the number of people will be thereby much lessened in the kingdom,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a fan of the number of people in the kingdom.",chit-chat
this i freely own and was indeed one principal design in offering it to the world,novel
that's really cool. what kind of design was it? i've always wanted to design something like that.,chit-chat
i desire the reader will observe that i calculate my remedy for this one individual kingdom of ireland and for no other that ever was is or i think ever can be upon earth,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you can find a way to make it up to the reader.,chit-chat
therefore let no man talk to me of other expedients of taxing our absentees at five shillings a pound of using neither clothes nor houshold furniture except what is of our own growth and manufacture of utterly rejecting the materials and instruments that promote foreign luxury of curing the expensiveness of pride vanity idleness and gaming in our women of introducing a vein of parsimony prudence and temperance of learning to love our country wherein we differ even from laplanders and the inhabitants of topinamboo of quitting our animosities and factions nor acting any longer like the jews who were murdering one another at the very moment their city was taken of being a little cautious not to sell our country and consciences for nothing of teaching landlords to have at least one degree of mercy towards their tenants,novel
that's a lot of words to say. i'm sorry you feel that way.,chit-chat
lastly of putting a spirit of honesty industry and skill into our shopkeepers who if a resolution could now be taken to buy only our native goods would immediately unite to cheat and exact upon us in the price the measure and the goodness nor could ever yet be brought to make one fair proposal of just dealing though often and earnestly invited to it,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. what kind of things do you like to do in your free time?,chit-chat
therefore i repeat let no man talk to me of these and the like expedients till he hath at least some glympse of hope that there will ever be some hearty and sincere attempt to put them into practice,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
but as to myself having been wearied out for many years with offering vain idle visionary thoughts and at length utterly despairing of success i fortunately fell upon this proposal which as it is wholly new so it hath something solid and real of no expence and little trouble full in our own power and whereby we can incur no danger in disobliging england,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find peace.,chit-chat
for this kind of commodity will not bear exportation and flesh being of too tender a consistence to admit a long continuance in salt although perhaps i could name a country which would be glad to eat up our whole nation without it,novel
i would love to live in a country where i could eat up our whole nation without it.,chit-chat
after all i am not so violently bent upon my own opinion as to reject any offer proposed by wise men which shall be found equally innocent cheap easy and effectual,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to work things out.,chit-chat
but before something of that kind shall be advanced in contradiction to my scheme and offering a better i desire the author or authors will be pleased maturely to consider two points,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm not sure i could do that.,chit-chat
first as things now stand how they will be able to find food and raiment for a hundred thousand useless mouths and backs,novel
that's a lot of useless mouths and backs. i don't think i'd want to live there.,chit-chat
and secondly there being a round million of creatures in humane figure throughout this kingdom whose whole subsistence put into a common stock would leave them in debt two million of pounds sterling adding those who are beggars by profession to the bulk of farmers cottagers and labourers with their wives and children who are beggars in effect i desire those politicians who dislike my overture and may perhaps be so bold to attempt an answer that they will first ask the parents of these mortals whether they would not at this day think it a great happiness to have been sold for food at a year old in the manner i prescribe and thereby have avoided such a perpetual scene of misfortunes as they have since gone through by the oppression of landlords the impossibility of paying rent without money or trade the want of common sustenance with neither house nor clothes to cover them from the inclemencies of the weather and the most inevitable prospect of intailing the like or greater miseries upon their breed for ever,novel
i'm not sure what you're trying to say. are you trying to make a point?,chit-chat
i profess in the sincerity of my heart that i have not the least personal interest in endeavouring to promote this necessary work having no other motive than the publick good of my country by advancing our trade providing for infants relieving the poor and giving some pleasure to the rich,novel
that's very noble of you. i'm glad you're doing something to help the poor.,chit-chat
i have no children by which i can propose to get a single penny the youngest being nine years old and my wife past childbearing,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. do you think you'll be able to do it?,chit-chat
