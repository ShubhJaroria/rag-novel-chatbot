the averages or means of series of indices obtained from one people have been compared with those obtained from other peoples but this method is misleading as there is frequently a very considerable range in any given series and a mean merely gives a colourless conception of racial types the only value of which is a ready standard of comparison which however is full of pitfalls,novel
