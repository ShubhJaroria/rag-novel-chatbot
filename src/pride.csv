i'm not sure what you're trying to say. are you trying to tell me something?,chit-chat
illustration _walt whitman has somewhere a fine and just distinction between loving by allowance and loving with personal love this distinction applies to books as well as to men and women and in the case of the not very numerous authors who are the objects of the personal affection it brings a curious consequence with it,novel
that's interesting. do you have a favorite author? i've read a few of his books.,chit-chat
there is much more difference as to their best work than in the case of those others who are loved by allowance by convention and because it is felt to be the right and proper thing to love them,novel
that's a good point. it's hard for me to believe that they've been doing this for so long.,chit-chat
and in the sectfairly large and yet unusually choiceof austenians or janites there would probably be found partisans of the claim to primacy of almost every one of the novels,novel
"i've never read any of the novels, but i'd love to read some of them.",chit-chat
to some the delightful freshness and humour of_ northanger abbey _its completeness finish and_ entrain _obscure the undoubted critical facts that its scale is small and its scheme after all that of burlesque or parody a kind in which the first rank is reached with difficulty_ persuasion _relatively faint in tone and not enthralling in interest has devotees who exalt above all the others its exquisite delicacy and keeping,novel
i've never heard of it. i'll have to check it out. what's it about?,chit-chat
the catastrophe of_ mansfield park _is admittedly theatrical the hero and heroine are insipid and the author has almost wickedly destroyed all romantic interest by expressly admitting that edmund only took fanny because mary shocked him and that fanny might very likely have taken crawford if he had been a little more assiduous yet the matchless rehearsalscenes and the characters of mrs norris and others have secured i believe a considerable party for it_ sense and sensibility _has perhaps the fewest outandout admirers but it does not want them_ _i suppose however that the majority of at least competent votes would all things considered be divided between_ emma _and the present book and perhaps the vulgar verdict if indeed a fondness for miss austen be not of itself a patent of exemption from any possible charge of vulgarity would go for_ emma,novel
"i don't know much about mansfield park, but i do know that it's one of my favorites.",chit-chat
_it is the larger the more varied the more popular the author had by the time of its composition seen rather more of the world and had improved her general though not her most peculiar and characteristic dialogue such figures as miss bates as the eltons can not but unite the suffrages of everybody,novel
"i've never read a book by miss bates, but i'm sure it's interesting. what's your favorite book by her?",chit-chat
on the other hand i for my part declare for_ pride and prejudice _unhesitatingly,novel
"i'm sorry to hear that. what do you do for pride and prejudice, if you don't mind me asking?",chit-chat
it seems to me the most perfect the most characteristic the most eminently quintessential of its authors works and for this contention in such narrow space as is permitted to me i propose here to show cause_ _in the first place the book it may be barely necessary to remind the reader was in its first shape written very early somewhere about 1796 when miss austen was barely twentyone though it was revised and finished at chawton some fifteen years later and was not published till 1813 only four years before her death,novel
"wow, that's a long time ago. i didn't know it was that long ago.",chit-chat
i do not know whether in this combination of the fresh and vigorous projection of youth and the critical revision of middle life there may be traced the distinct superiority in point of construction which as it seems to me it possesses over all the others,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure i'd agree with that.,chit-chat
the plot though not elaborate is almost regular enough for fielding hardly a character hardly an incident could be retrenched without loss to the story,novel
that's a good point. i'll have to think about that. it's been a while since i've seen it.,chit-chat
the elopement of lydia and wickham is not like that of crawford and mrs rushworth a_ coup de théâtre _it connects itself in the strictest way with the course of the story earlier and brings about the denouement with complete propriety,novel
i don't think i've ever heard of mrs rushworth. what's her name?,chit-chat
all the minor passagesthe loves of jane and bingley the advent of mr collins the visit to hunsford the derbyshire tourfit in after the same unostentatious but masterly fashion,novel
i've never heard of hunsford the derby before. what's the name of the tourfit?,chit-chat
there is no attempt at the hideandseek inandout business which in the transactions between frank churchill and jane fairfax contributes no doubt a good deal to the intrigue of_ emma _but contributes it in a fashion which i do not think the best feature of that otherwise admirable book,novel
i've never heard of hideandseek inandout. i'll have to check it out.,chit-chat
although miss austen always liked something of the misunderstanding kind which afforded her opportunities for the display of the peculiar and incomparable talent to be noticed presently she has been satisfied here with the perfectly natural occasions provided by the false account of darcys conduct given by wickham and by the awkwardness arising with equal naturalness from the gradual transformation of elizabeths own feelings from positive aversion to actual love,novel
"hello, miss austen. how are you doing today? i hope you are doing well.",chit-chat
i do not know whether the allgrasping hand of the playwright has ever been laid upon_ pride and prejudice _and i dare say that if it were the situations would prove not startling or garish enough for the footlights the characterscheme too subtle and delicate for pit and gallery,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure i've ever been laid up like that.,chit-chat
but if the attempt were made it would certainly not be hampered by any of those loosenesses of construction which sometimes disguised by the conveniences of which the novelist can avail himself appear at once on the stage_ _i think however though the thought will doubtless seem heretical to more than one school of critics that construction is not the highest merit the choicest gift of the novelist,novel
that's a very good point. i'm not sure if i agree with that.,chit-chat
it sets off his other gifts and graces most advantageously to the critical eye and the want of it will sometimes mar those gracesappreciably though not quite consciouslyto eyes by no means ultracritical,novel
i don't think i've ever had that happen to me. i'm not sure what it is.,chit-chat
but a very badlybuilt novel which excelled in pathetic or humorous character or which displayed consummate command of dialogueperhaps the rarest of all facultieswould be an infinitely better thing than a faultless plot acted and told by puppets with pebbles in their mouths,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a big fan of puppets with pebbles in their mouths.",chit-chat
and despite the ability which miss austen has shown in working out the story i for one should put_ pride and prejudice _far lower if it did not contain what seem to me the very masterpieces of miss austens humour and of her faculty of charactercreationmasterpieces who may indeed admit john thorpe the eltons mrs norris and one or two others to their company but who in one instance certainly and perhaps in others are still superior to them_ _the characteristics of miss austens humour are so subtle and delicate that they are perhaps at all times easier to apprehend than to express and at any particular time likely to be differently apprehended by different persons,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a fan of miss austen humor.",chit-chat
to me this humour seems to possess a greater affinity on the whole to that of addison than to any other of the numerous species of this great british genus,novel
"i'm not sure what you mean by that, but i agree. it's so funny.",chit-chat
the differences of scheme of time of subject of literary convention are of course obvious enough the difference of sex does not perhaps count for much for there was a distinctly feminine element in mr,novel
i don't think i've ever read mr. i'll have to check it out.,chit-chat
spectator and in jane austens genius there was though nothing mannish much that was masculine,novel
spectator is one of my favorite movies of all time. it was made by james cameron.,chit-chat
but the likeness of quality consists in a great number of common subdivisions of qualitydemureness extreme minuteness of touch avoidance of loud tones and glaring effects,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure i've ever felt that way before.,chit-chat
also there is in both a certain not inhuman or unamiable cruelty,novel
"that's true, but i'm not sure if i'd call it cruelty.",chit-chat
it is the custom with those who judge grossly to contrast the good nature of addison with the savagery of swift the mildness of miss austen with the boisterousness of fielding and smollett even with the ferocious practical jokes that her immediate predecessor miss burney allowed without very much protest,novel
i don't think i've ever heard of her. what's her name?,chit-chat
yet both in mr addison and in miss austen there is though a restrained and wellmannered an insatiable and ruthless delight in roasting and cutting up a fool,novel
i've never heard of miss austen. what's she up to these days?,chit-chat
a man in the early eighteenth century of course could push this taste further than a lady in the early nineteenth and no doubt miss austens principles as well as her heart would have shrunk from such things as the letter from the unfortunate husband in the_ spectator _who describes with all the gusto and all the innocence in the world how his wife and his friend induce him to play at blindmansbuff,novel
"i don't know much about miss austens, but i do know that she was one of the most influential women in the 20th century.",chit-chat
but another_ spectator _letterthat of the damsel of fourteen who wishes to marry mr shapely and assures her selected mentor that he admires your_ spectators _mightilymight have been written by a rather more ladylike and intelligent lydia bennet in the days of lydias greatgrandmother while on the other hand some i think unreasonably have found cynicism in touches of miss austens own such as her satire of mrs musgroves selfdeceiving regrets over her son,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a cynicism fan.",chit-chat
but this word cynical is one of the most misused in the english language especially when by a glaring and gratuitous falsification of its original sense it is applied not to rough and snarling invective but to gentle and oblique satire,novel
"i agree. i think it's funny that the word "" cynical "" was first used in the 19th century.",chit-chat
if cynicism means the perception of the other side the sense of the accepted hells beneath the consciousness that motives are nearly always mixed and that to seem is not identical with to beif this be cynicism then every man and woman who is not a fool who does not care to live in a fools paradise who has knowledge of nature and the world and life is a cynic,novel
"i'm not sure what you mean by cynicism, but i do agree with what you're saying.",chit-chat
and in that sense miss austen certainly was one,novel
"i'm not sure what you mean. are you referring to miss austen, the american singer?",chit-chat
she may even have been one in the further sense that like her own mr bennet she took an epicurean delight in dissecting in displaying in setting at work her fools and her mean persons,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i don't think i could do that.,chit-chat
i think she did take this delight and i do not think at all the worse of her for it as a woman while she was immensely the better for it as an artist_ _in respect of her art generally mr goldwin smith has truly observed that metaphor has been exhausted in depicting the perfection of it combined with the narrowness of her field and he has justly added that we need not go beyond her own comparison to the art of a miniature painter,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a fan of miniature painter.",chit-chat
to make this latter observation quite exact we must not use the term miniature in its restricted sense and must think rather of memling at one end of the history of painting and meissonier at the other than of cosway or any of his kind,novel
i'm not sure what you're trying to say. what do you mean by that?,chit-chat
and i am not so certain that i should myself use the word narrow in connection with her,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. do you think you'll be able to work things out?,chit-chat
if her world is a microcosm the cosmic quality of it is at least as eminent as the littleness,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you referring to the quality of my work?,chit-chat
she does not touch what she did not feel herself called to paint i am not so sure that she could not have painted what she did not feel herself called to touch,novel
i don't think she could have painted what she didn't feel herself to paint.,chit-chat
it is at least remarkable that in two very short periods of writingone of about three years and another of not much more than fiveshe executed six capital works and has not left a single failure,novel
"wow, that's impressive. i'm not sure i'd be able to do that.",chit-chat
it is possible that the romantic paste in her composition was defective we must always remember that hardly anybody born in her decadethat of the eighteenthcentury seventiesindependently exhibited the full romantic quality,novel
that's a good point. it's hard to believe that she's still alive.,chit-chat
even scott required hill and mountain and ballad even coleridge metaphysics and german to enable them to chip the classical shell,novel
i've never heard of coleridge metaphysics. what's it about?,chit-chat
miss austen was an english girl brought up in a country retirement at the time when ladies went back into the house if there was a white frost which might pierce their kid shoes when a sudden cold was the subject of the gravest fears when their studies their ways their conduct were subject to all those fantastic limits and restrictions against which mary wollstonecraft protested with better general sense than particular taste or judgment,novel
wollstonecraft is my favorite author. she was a great english novelist and novelist.,chit-chat
miss austen too drew back when the white frost touched her shoes but i think she would have made a pretty good journey even in a black one_ _for if her knowledge was not very extended she knew two things which only genius knows,novel
i don't know about that. i think she would have made a pretty good journey even in a black oneome for if her knowledge was not very extended she knew two things which only genius knows.,chit-chat
the one was humanity and the other was art,novel
the one was humanity and the the other was art is a great one. i love art.,chit-chat
on the first head she could not make a mistake her men though limited are true and her women are in the old sense absolute as to art if she has never tried idealism her realism is real to a degree which makes the false realism of our own day look merely deadalive,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a fan of women in general.",chit-chat
take almost any frenchman except the late m de maupassant and watch him laboriously piling up strokes in the hope of giving a complete impression,novel
i love frenchman. he's one of my favorite comedians. have you heard of him?,chit-chat
you get none you are lucky if discarding twothirds of what he gives you can shape a real impression out of the rest,novel
that's true. i guess i'll just have to wait and see how it goes.,chit-chat
but with miss austen the myriad trivial unforced strokes build up the picture like magic,novel
i have never heard of miss austen the myriad. is she a singer or songwriter?,chit-chat
nothing is false nothing is superfluous,novel
that's a good way to put it. i like to think of myself as superfluous.,chit-chat
when to take the present book only mr collins changed his mind from jane to elizabeth while mrs bennet was stirring the fire and we know_ how _mrs,novel
that's interesting. did you find out how mrs. bennet was stir the fire?,chit-chat
bennet would have stirred the fire when mr darcy brought his coffeecup back_ himself _the touch in each case is like that of swifttaller by the breadth of my nailwhich impressed the halfreluctant thackeray with just and outspoken admiration,novel
bennet would have stirred the fire when mr darcy brought his coffeecup back_ himself * the touch in each case is like that of swifttaller by the breadth of my nailwhich impressed the halfreluctant thackeray with just and outspoken admiration,chit-chat
indeed fantastic as it may seem i should put miss austen as near to swift in some ways as i have put her to addison in others_ _this swiftian quality appears in the present novel as it appears nowhere else in the character of the immortal the ineffable mr collins,novel
"i haven't read the immortal, but i've heard good things about it. i'll have to check it out.",chit-chat
mr collins is really_ great _far greater than anything addison ever did almost great enough for fielding or for swift himself,novel
"i've never heard of him, but i'll look him up. what's his name?",chit-chat
it has been said that no one ever was like him,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
but in the first place_ he _was like him he is therealive imperishable more real than hundreds of prime ministers and archbishops of metals semimetals and distinguished philosophers in the second place it is rash i think to conclude that an actual mr collins was impossible or nonexistent at the end of the eighteenth century,novel
i don't think so. i think it's more likely that he was just a figment of our imagination.,chit-chat
it is very interesting that we possess in this same gallery what may be called a spoiled first draught or an unsuccessful study of him in john dashwood,novel
i've never heard of john dashwood. i'll have to check it out.,chit-chat
the formality the underbreeding the meanness are there but the portrait is only half alive and is felt to be even a little unnatural,novel
that's a good way to look at it. what do you think of the portrait?,chit-chat
mr collins is perfectly natural and perfectly alive,novel
"i love mr. collins. he is a great singer, songwriter, actor, and actor.",chit-chat
in fact for all the miniature there is something gigantic in the way in which a certain side and more than one of humanity and especially eighteenthcentury humanity its philistinism its wellmeaning but hidebound morality its formal pettiness its grovelling respect for rank its materialism its selfishness receives exhibition,novel
that's a great way to put it. i'm not sure i've ever thought about it that way before.,chit-chat
i will not admit that one speech or one action of this inestimable man is incapable of being reconciled with reality and i should not wonder if many of these words and actions are historically true_ _but the greatness of mr collins could not have been so satisfactorily exhibited if his creatress had not adjusted so artfully to him the figures of mr bennet and of lady catherine de bourgh,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a fan of mr. bennet.",chit-chat
the latter like mr collins himself has been charged with exaggeration,novel
i didn't know he was charged with exaggeration. what did he get charged with?,chit-chat
there is perhaps a very faint shade of colour for the charge but it seems to me very faint indeed,novel
that's what i'm thinking too. it's hard to tell what color it is.,chit-chat
even now i do not think that it would be impossible to find persons especially female persons not necessarily of noble birth as overbearing as selfcentred as neglectful of good manners as lady catherine,novel
i don't think it would be impossible to find people especially female persons not necessarily of noble birth as overbearing as selfcentred as neglectful of good manners as lady catherine,chit-chat
a hundred years ago an earls daughter the lady powerful if not exactly bountiful of an outoftheway country parish rich long out of marital authority and so forth had opportunities of developing these agreeable characteristics which seldom present themselves now,novel
"wow, that's a long time ago. do you have a source for that information?",chit-chat
as for mr bennet miss austen and mr darcy and even miss elizabeth herself were i am inclined to think rather hard on him for the impropriety of his conduct,novel
"i don't know much about mr. bennet, but i do know that mr. darcy is an american singer and songwriter.",chit-chat
his wife was evidently and must always have been a quite irreclaimable fool and unless he had shot her or himself there was no way out of it for a man of sense and spirit but the ironic,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a fan of his wife.",chit-chat
from no other point of view is he open to any reproach except for an excusable and not unnatural helplessness at the crisis of the elopement and his utterances are the most acutely delightful in the consciously humorous kindin the kind that we laugh with not atthat even miss austen has put into the mouth of any of her characters,novel
i'm not familiar with miss austen. what's her name? i've never heard of her.,chit-chat
it is difficult to know whether he is most agreeable when talking to his wife or when putting mr collins through his paces but the general sense of the world has probably been right in preferring to the first rank his consolation to the former when she maunders over the entail my dear do not give way to such gloomy thoughts,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by gloomy thoughts. what are you talking about?,chit-chat
let us hope for better things,novel
"i hope so, but i'm not sure if it's going to work out.",chit-chat
let us flatter ourselves that_ i _may be the survivor and his inquiry to his colossal cousin as to the compliments which mr collins has just related as made by himself to lady catherine may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment or are the result of previous study these are the things which give miss austens readers the pleasant shocks the delightful thrills which are felt by the readers of swift of fielding and we may here add of thackeray as they are felt by the readers of no other english author of fiction outside of these four_ _the goodness of the minor characters in_ pride and prejudice _has been already alluded to and it makes a detailed dwelling on their beauties difficult in any space and impossible in this,novel
i'm not sure what you're trying to say. are you trying to make fun of me?,chit-chat
mrs bennet we have glanced at and it is not easy to say whether she is more exquisitely amusing or more horribly true,novel
"i'm not familiar with mrs bennet, but i know she's an american comedian.",chit-chat
much the same may be said of kitty and lydia but it is not every author even of genius who would have differentiated with such unerring skill the effects of folly and vulgarity of intellect and disposition working upon the common weaknesses of woman at such different ages,novel
i don't think i've ever read kitty and lydia. i'll have to check it out.,chit-chat
with mary miss austen has taken rather less pains though she has been even more unkind to her not merely in the text but as we learn from those interesting traditional appendices which mr austen leigh has given us in dooming her privately to marry one of mr philipss clerks the habits of first copying and then retailing moral sentiments of playing and singing too long in public are no doubt grievous and criminal but perhaps poor mary was rather the scapegoat of the sins of blue stockings in that fordycebelectured generation,novel
i'm not familiar with mrs austen leigh. what does she do for a living?,chit-chat
it is at any rate difficult not to extend to her a share of the respect and affection affection and respect of a peculiar kind doubtless with which one regards mr collins when she draws the moral of lydias fall,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get through it.,chit-chat
i sometimes wish that the exigencies of the story had permitted miss austen to unite these personages and thus at once achieve a notable mating and soothe poor mrs bennets anguish over the entail_ _the bingleys and the gardiners and the lucases miss darcy and miss de bourgh jane wickham and the rest must pass without special comment further than the remark that charlotte lucas her egregious papa though delightful is just a little on the thither side of the line between comedy and farce is a wonderfully clever study in drab of one kind and that wickham though something of miss austens hesitation of touch in dealing with young men appears is a not much less notable sketch in drab of another,novel
i don't think i've ever seen that sketch. what's it about?,chit-chat
only genius could have made charlotte what she is yet not disagreeable wickham what he is without investing him either with a cheap don juanish attractiveness or a disgusting rascality,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a fan of don juanish attractiveness.",chit-chat
but the hero and the heroine are not tints to be dismissed_ _darcy has always seemed to me by far the best and most interesting of miss austens heroes the only possible competitor being henry tilney whose part is so slight and simple that it hardly enters into comparison,novel
i agree. i love miss austens heroes. it's hard to believe that she was born in 1903.,chit-chat
it has sometimes i believe been urged that his pride is unnatural at first in its expression and later in its yielding while his falling in love at all is not extremely probable,novel
that's interesting. i don't think i've ever seen that happen before.,chit-chat
here again i can not go with the objectors,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what's wrong with the objector's?,chit-chat
darcys own account of the way in which his pride had been pampered is perfectly rational and sufficient and nothing could be psychologically speaking a_ causa verior _for its sudden restoration to healthy conditions than the shock of elizabeths scornful refusal acting on a nature_ ex hypothesi _generous,novel
"i don't know much about darcys, but i do know that he is one of my favorite writers.",chit-chat
nothing in even our author is finer and more delicately touched than the change of his demeanour at the sudden meeting in the grounds of pemberley,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did pemberley say about the meeting?,chit-chat
had he been a bad prig or a bad coxcomb he might have been still smarting under his rejection or suspicious that the girl had come husbandhunting,novel
i don't think he was a bad prig or a bad coxcomb. i think he just didn't care.,chit-chat
his being neither is exactly consistent with the probable feelings of a man spoilt in the common sense but not really injured in disposition and thoroughly in love,novel
i don't think he's a spoilt. i think he just doesn't like me.,chit-chat
as for his being in love elizabeth has given as just an exposition of the causes of that phenomenon as darcy has of the conditions of his unregenerate state only she has of course not counted in what was due to her own personal charm_ _the secret of that charm many men and not a few women from miss austen herself downwards have felt and like most charms it is a thing rather to be felt than to be explained,novel
i don't think i've ever heard of miss austen. what's her name?,chit-chat
elizabeth of course belongs to the_ allegro _or_ allegra _division of the army of venus,novel
"i'm not familiar with the army of venus, but i do know that it's the largest military in the world.",chit-chat
miss austen was always provokingly chary of description in regard to her beauties and except the fine eyes and a hint or two that she had at any rate sometimes a bright complexion and was not very tall we hear nothing about her looks,novel
"that's interesting, i didn't know that. do you know who she was?",chit-chat
but her chief difference from other heroines of the lively type seems to lie first in her being distinctly cleveralmost strongminded in the better sense of that objectionable wordand secondly in her being entirely destitute of illnature for all her propensity to tease and the sharpness of her tongue,novel
"i don't know about you, but i think i'd rather be a woman than a man.",chit-chat
elizabeth can give at least as good as she gets when she is attacked but she never scratches and she never attacks first,novel
elizabeth is one of my favorite characters. she's such a great character. what's your favorite character?,chit-chat
some of the merest obsoletenesses of phrase and manner give one or two of her early speeches a slight pertness but that is nothing and when she comes to serious business as in the great proposal scene with darcy which is as it should be the climax of the interest of the book and in the final ladies battle with lady catherine she is unexceptionable,novel
i don't think i've ever seen that movie. what's it about?,chit-chat
then too she is a perfectly natural girl,novel
that's what i was thinking. i'm glad she's doing well for herself.,chit-chat
she does not disguise from herself or anybody that she resents darcys first illmannered personality with as personal a feeling,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i don't think i could do that.,chit-chat
by the way the reproach that the illmanners of this speech are overdone is certainly unjust for things of the same kind expressed no doubt less stiltedly but more coarsely might have been heard in more than one ballroom during this very year from persons who ought to have been no worse bred than darcy,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a fan of this type of speech.",chit-chat
and she lets the injury done to jane and the contempt shown to the rest of her family aggravate this resentment in the healthiest way in the world_ _still all this does not explain her charm which taking beauty as a common form of all heroines may perhaps consist in the addition to her playfulness her wit her affectionate and natural disposition of a certain fearlessness very uncommon in heroines of her type and age,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she's okay. what happened to jane?,chit-chat
nearly all of them would have been in speechless awe of the magnificent darcy nearly all of them would have palpitated and fluttered at the idea of proposals even naughty ones from the fascinating wickham,novel
i've never heard of wickham. i'll have to check it out. what's it about?,chit-chat
elizabeth with nothing offensive nothing_ viraginous _nothing of the new woman about her has by nature what the best modern not new women have by education and experience a perfect freedom from the idea that all men may bully her if they choose and that most will away with her if they can,novel
i don't think i've ever heard of her before. what's her name?,chit-chat
though not in the least impudent and mannish grown she has no mere sensibility no nasty niceness about her,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a fan of nasty people.",chit-chat

miss bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her elizabeth listened in silence but was not convinced their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself she was very little disposed to approve them,novel

they were rather handsome had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds were in the habit of spending more than they ought and of associating with people of rank and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves and meanly of others,novel

mr bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand pounds from his father who had intended to purchase an estate but did not live to do it,novel
"wow, that's a lot of money. i've never heard of mr bingley before.",chit-chat
mr bingley intended it likewise and sometimes made choice of his county but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield and leave the next generation to purchase,novel
i'm not familiar with mr bingley. what does he do for a living?,chit-chat
his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own but though he was now established only as a tenant miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table nor was mrs hurst who had married a man of more fashion than fortune less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her,novel

that's good to hear. it's always good to have a good friend in your life.,chit-chat
bingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness openness and ductility of his temper though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied,novel
i'm not familiar with bingley. what does he do that you don't know about him?,chit-chat
on the strength of darcys regard bingley had the firmest reliance and of his judgment the highest opinion,novel

"hey bingley, how are you doing today? i hope you are having a good day.",chit-chat
darcy on the contrary had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest and from none received either attention or pleasure,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. it must have been hard for him to feel that way.,chit-chat
miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty but she smiled too much,novel
"i'm sorry to hear that. miss bennet is a great singer, songwriter, and actress.",chit-chat
mrs hurst and her sister allowed it to be so but still they admired her and liked her and pronounced her to be a sweet girl and one whom they should not object to know more of,novel
i don't think i've ever heard of mrs hurst. what is her name?,chit-chat
miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl and their brother felt authorized by such commendation to think of her as he chose,novel
"i'm not familiar with miss bennet, but i know that she was a great actress.",chit-chat

that's really interesting. i've never heard of sir william lucas. is he famous?,chit-chat

for though elated by his rank it did not render him supercilious on the contrary he was all attention to everybody,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do to make him supercilious?,chit-chat
by nature inoffensive friendly and obliging his presentation at st jamess had made him courteous,novel

mr robinsons asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room and _which_ he thought the prettiest,novel
that's interesting. did you have a good time at meryton assembly? did you enjoy it?,chit-chat
and his answering immediately to the last question oh the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt there can not be two opinions on that point upon my word,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to talk to him about it.,chit-chat
well that was very decided indeedthat does seem as ifbut however it may all come to nothing you know _my_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_ eliza said charlotte,novel

i'm not familiar with miss bingley. what does she say about netherfield?,chit-chat
with _them_ he is remarkably agreeable i do not believe a word of it my dear,novel
i don't either. i can't even imagine what he must be up to.,chit-chat
if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to mrs long,novel
i don't think so. i think he was just trying to be nice to her.,chit-chat
but i can guess how it was everybody says that he is eat up with pride and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs long does not keep a carriage and had to come to the ball in a hack chaise i do not mind his not talking to mrs long said miss lucas but i wish he had danced with eliza another time lizzy said her mother i would not dance with _him_ if i were you i believe maam i may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him his pride said miss lucas does not offend _me_ so much as pride often does because there is an excuse for it,novel
i don't think he's eating up with pride. i think it's just the way he is.,chit-chat
one can not wonder that so very fine a young man with family fortune everything in his favour should think highly of himself,novel
that's true. i'm glad he's doing so well. i don't think i'd be able to live without him.,chit-chat
if i may so express it he has a _right_ to be proud that is very true replied elizabeth and i could easily forgive _his_ pride if he had not mortified _mine_ pride observed mary who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections is a very common failing i believe,novel
i don't think i've ever heard of that before. i'm not sure what you mean.,chit-chat
by all that i have ever read i am convinced that it is very common indeed that human nature is particularly prone to it and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of selfcomplacency on the score of some quality or other real or imaginary,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i don't think i've ever felt that way before.,chit-chat
vanity and pride are different things though the words are often used synonymously,novel
that's true. i'm not sure if i should be proud of myself or not.,chit-chat
a person may be proud without being vain,novel
that's true. i'm proud of them for doing what they're doing.,chit-chat
pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves vanity to what we would have others think of us if i were as rich as mr darcy cried a young lucas who came with his sisters i should not care how proud i was,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i feel the same way about pride.,chit-chat
i would keep a pack of foxhounds and drink a bottle of wine every day then you would drink a great deal more than you ought said mrs bennet and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly the boy protested that she should not she continued to declare that she would and the argument ended only with the visit,novel

how long did it take for you to get back to where you were before it was returned?,chit-chat
miss bennets pleasing manners grew on the goodwill of mrs hurst and miss bingley and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to a wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towards the two eldest,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find peace.,chit-chat
by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody hardly excepting even her sister and could not like them though their kindness to jane such as it was had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brothers admiration,novel
"i've never read that book, but i'm sure it's interesting. i'll have to check it out.",chit-chat
it was generally evident whenever they met that he _did_ admire her and to _her_ it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first and was in a way to be very much in love but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general since jane united with great strength of feeling a composure of temper and an uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent,novel
i've never read jane united. what is it about her that makes you think she's in love with him?,chit-chat
she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas,novel
that's really cool. i've never heard of miss lucas. what's her name?,chit-chat
it may perhaps be pleasant replied charlotte to be able to impose on the public in such a case but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded,novel
i don't think i'd be able to do that. i'm not sure i could do it.,chit-chat
if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it she may lose the opportunity of fixing him and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark,novel
i don't think that's true at all. i'm not sure what you mean by that.,chit-chat
there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself,novel
that's true. i think it's important to be grateful for what you have.,chit-chat
we can all _begin_ freelya slight preference is natural enough but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure if i could be in love without encouragement.,chit-chat
in nine cases out of ten a woman had better show _more_ affection than she feels,novel
"wow, that's a lot of women out there. how did you find out about that?",chit-chat
bingley likes your sister undoubtedly but he may never do more than like her if she does not help him on but she does help him on as much as her nature will allow,novel
"that's true, but i'm not sure if i can trust bingley.",chit-chat
if _i_ can perceive her regard for him he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too remember eliza that he does not know janes disposition as you do but if a woman is partial to a man and does not endeavor to conceal it he must find it out perhaps he must if he sees enough of her,novel
i don't think he is a simpleton. i think he just doesn't care.,chit-chat
but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often it is never for many hours together and as they always see each other in large mixed parties it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together,novel
that's true. it's hard to believe that bingley and jane have been together for so long.,chit-chat
jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention,novel
"that's a good idea, i'll try to do that next time she's around.",chit-chat
when she is secure of him there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses your plan is a good one replied elizabeth where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married and if i were determined to get a rich husband or any husband i dare say i should adopt it,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i think i'm going to do that.,chit-chat
but these are not janes feelings she is not acting by design,novel
"that's true, but i still feel bad for her. i can't help it.",chit-chat
as yet she can not even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness,novel
that's true. i'm not sure if she's a good person or not.,chit-chat
she has known him only a fortnight,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she's able to get over it.,chit-chat
she danced four dances with him at meryton she saw him one morning at his own house and has since dined in company with him four times,novel
"wow, that's a long time to be with someone you don't know. i'm sorry to hear that.",chit-chat
this is not quite enough to make her understand his character not as you represent it,novel
i don't think so. i'm not sure what i can do about it.,chit-chat

she really looked almost wild she did indeed louisa,novel
she really looked almost wild... what did she look like exactly? i don't get it.,chit-chat
i could hardly keep my countenance,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do to keep your countenance?,chit-chat
very nonsensical to come at all,novel
"i know, it's so weird. i don't know what i'm going to do.",chit-chat
why must _she_ be scampering about the country because her sister had a cold,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she's feeling better. what's going on with her sister?,chit-chat
her hair so untidy so blowzy yes and her petticoat i hope you saw her petticoat six inches deep in mud i am absolutely certain and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office your picture may be very exact louisa said bingley but this was all lost upon me,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find it.,chit-chat
i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning,novel
what did she look like? i don't know much about miss elizabeth bennet...,chit-chat
her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice _you_ observed it mr darcy i am sure said miss bingley and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such an exhibition certainly not to walk three miles or four miles or five miles or whatever it is above her ancles in dirt and alone quite alone,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find peace with her.,chit-chat
what could she mean by it,novel
i don't know... i'm not sure what to say to her.,chit-chat
it seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence a most countrytown indifference to decorum it shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing said bingley,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm not sure i could do that.,chit-chat
i am afraid mr darcy observed miss bingley in a half whisper that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes not at all he replied they were brightened by the exercise a short pause followed this speech and mrs hurst began again i have an excessive regard for jane bennetshe is really a very sweet girland i wish with all my heart she were well settled,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope she's doing well for herself.,chit-chat
but with such a father and mother and such low connections i am afraid there is no chance of it i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in meryton yes and they have another who lives somewhere near cheapside that is capital added her sister and they both laughed heartily,novel
i don't think i've ever heard of meryton yes. i'll have to check it out.,chit-chat
if they had uncles enough to fill _all_ cheapside cried bingley it would not make them one jot less agreeable but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world replied darcy,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a cheapside. i've never been in a relationship.",chit-chat
to this speech bingley made no answer but his sisters gave it their hearty assent and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friends vulgar relations,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
with a renewal of tenderness however they repaired to her room on leaving the diningparlour and sat with her till summoned to coffee,novel
that's really nice of them. i'm sure they had a lot of fun.,chit-chat
she was still very poorly and elizabeth would not quit her at all till late in the evening when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you were able to get some rest.,chit-chat
on entering the drawingroom she found the whole party at loo and was immediately invited to join them but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it and making her sister the excuse said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book,novel
that's not very nice of her. i'm sorry you had to go through that.,chit-chat
mr hurst looked at her with astonishment,novel
i'm not familiar with mr. hurst. what does he do in his spare time?,chit-chat
do you prefer reading to cards said he that is rather singular miss eliza bennet said miss bingley despises cards,novel
i don't think i've ever heard of that card. i'll have to look it up.,chit-chat
she is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else i deserve neither such praise nor such censure cried elizabeth i am _not_ a great reader and i have pleasure in many things in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure said bingley and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well elizabeth thanked him from her heart and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get through it.,chit-chat
he immediately offered to fetch her others all that his library afforded,novel
"oh my god, that's terrible. i'm sorry to hear that. what did he do?",chit-chat
and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit but i am an idle fellow and though i have not many i have more than i ever looked into elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what do you like to do in your spare time?,chit-chat
i am astonished said miss bingley that my father should have left so small a collection of books,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did he do to make you feel that way?,chit-chat
what a delightful library you have at pemberley mr darcy it ought to be good he replied it has been the work of many generations and then you have added so much to it yourselfyou are always buying books i can not comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these neglect,novel
i agree. it's a shame that we can't have more books in the library.,chit-chat
i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place,novel
i'm sure you're right. it's been a long time since i've been there.,chit-chat
charles when you build _your_ house i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley i wish it may but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood and take pemberley for a kind of model,novel
i've never heard of pemberley before. i'll have to look into it.,chit-chat
there is not a finer county in england than derbyshire with all my heart i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it i am talking of possibilities charles upon my word caroline i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation elizabeth was so much caught by what passed as to leave her very little attention for her book and soon laying it wholly aside she drew near the cardtable and stationed herself between mr bingley and his eldest sister to observe the game,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to buy pemberley.,chit-chat
is miss darcy much grown since the spring said miss bingley will she be as tall as i am i think she will,novel

her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite it is amazing to me said bingley how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are all young ladies accomplished,novel
i agree. i think it's amazing that she's been able to do that for so long.,chit-chat
my dear charles what do you mean yes all of them i think,novel
yes all of them! i'm so happy for him. he's such a great person.,chit-chat
they all paint tables cover screens and net purses,novel
i've never heard of that before. i'll have to look into it more.,chit-chat
i scarcely know any one who can not do all this and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time without being informed that she was very accomplished your list of the common extent of accomplishments said darcy has too much truth,novel
thank you so much for your kind words. i'm so proud of her for accomplishing so many things.,chit-chat
the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general,novel
i don't think i've ever seen a woman netting a purse or covering a screen.,chit-chat
i can not boast of knowing more than halfadozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really accomplished nor i i am sure said miss bingley,novel
"i'm sorry to hear that. what did you say about miss bingley, if you don't mind me asking?",chit-chat
then observed elizabeth you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman yes i do comprehend a great deal in it oh certainly cried his faithful assistant no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'd rather be a woman than a man.",chit-chat
a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawing dancing and the modern languages to deserve the word and besides all this she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking the tone of her voice her address and expressions or the word will be but half deserved all this she must possess added darcy and to all she must yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading i am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women,novel
"wow, that's a lot of words to say. i'm not sure what you mean by that.",chit-chat
i rather wonder now at your knowing _any_ are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this _i_ never saw such a woman,novel
i don't think i've ever seen such a woman before. i'm not sure what you mean by that.,chit-chat
_i_ never saw such capacity and taste and application and elegance as you describe united mrs hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description when mr hurst called them to order with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward,novel
i have never seen such capacity and application and elegance as you describe united mrs. bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt and were both protest that they knew many women who answered that description when mr hurst called them to order with bitter complaints of what was going forward,chit-chat
as all conversation was thereby at an end elizabeth soon afterwards left the room,novel
that's pretty cool. did you get to talk to her again? did you find out who she was?,chit-chat
eliza bennet said miss bingley when the door was closed on her is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own and with many men i daresay it succeeds but in my opinion it is a paltry device a very mean art undoubtedly replied darcy to whom this remark was chiefly addressed there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation,novel
i don't think i've ever heard of miss bingley. who is she?,chit-chat
whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject,novel
"i don't like miss bingley, but i'm glad she's gone.",chit-chat
elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse and that she could not leave her,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
bingley urged mr joness being sent for immediately while his sisters convinced that no country advice could be of any service recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians,novel
"i've never heard of bingley, but i'm familiar with him. what's his name?",chit-chat
this she would not hear of but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brothers proposal and it was settled that mr jones should be sent for early in the morning if miss bennet were not decidedly better,novel
i'm sorry to hear about miss bennet. i hope she's doing better now.,chit-chat
bingley was quite uncomfortable his sisters declared that they were miserable,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did they say to bingley's sisters?,chit-chat
they solaced their wretchedness however by duets after supper while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find peace.,chit-chat

i've never heard of mr bingley before. what does he do for a living?,chit-chat
in spite of this amendment however she requested to have a note sent to longbourn desiring her mother to visit jane and form her own judgment of her situation,novel

mrs bennet accompanied by her two youngest girls reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast,novel
that must have been very exciting for them. did you have a good time with your family?,chit-chat
had she found jane in any apparent danger mrs bennet would have been very miserable but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming she had no wish of her recovering immediately as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think of that. i wonder if she would have been able to recover.,chit-chat
she would not listen therefore to her daughters proposal of being carried home neither did the apothecary who arrived about the same time think it at all advisable,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to work things out.,chit-chat
after sitting a little while with jane on miss bingleys appearance and invitation the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour,novel

we must trespass a little longer on your kindness removed cried bingley,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
it must not be thought of,novel
"it must not have been thought of, either. i'm not sure what to make of it.",chit-chat
my sister i am sure will not hear of her removal you may depend upon it madam said miss bingley with cold civility that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us mrs bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments,novel
i am so sorry to hear that. i hope you are able to find peace with her.,chit-chat
i am sure she added if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her for she is very ill indeed and suffers a vast deal though with the greatest patience in the world which is always the way with her for she has without exception the sweetest temper i ever met with,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get through it.,chit-chat
i often tell my other girls they are nothing to _her_,novel
"that's kind of you to do, but i don't think it's the right thing to do.",chit-chat
you have a sweet room here mr bingley and a charming prospect over that gravel walk,novel
that's so true! i'm so happy for him. he's such a sweetheart.,chit-chat

i'm sorry to hear that. what is it that you don't know a place in the country that is equal to netherfield?,chit-chat
you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i hope though you have but a short lease whatever i do is done in a hurry replied he and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield i should probably be off in five minutes,novel
that's a good idea. i think i'm going to do the same thing.,chit-chat
at present however i consider myself as quite fixed here that is exactly what i should have supposed of you said elizabeth,novel
that's a good way to look at it. what do you do for a living?,chit-chat
you begin to comprehend me do you cried he turning towards her,novel
i don't think so. i think he's just trying to make me feel better.,chit-chat
oh yesi understand you perfectly i wish i might take this for a compliment but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is pitiful that is as it happens,novel
i'm not pitiful at all. i don't care what anyone thinks.,chit-chat
it does not necessarily follow that a deep intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours lizzy cried her mother remember where you are and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home i did not know before continued bingley immediately that you were a studier of character,novel
that's a great way to look at it. i'm glad you're able to relate.,chit-chat
it must be an amusing study yes but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing,novel
"i agree, it's a lot of fun to watch. i'm not sure if i'll ever watch it again.",chit-chat
they have at least that advantage the country said darcy can in general supply but few subjects for such a study,novel
that's true. i think it's a good thing that they have such an advantage.,chit-chat
in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society but people themselves alter so much that there is something new to be observed in them for ever yes indeed cried mrs bennet offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood,novel
i don't think i've ever heard of mrs bennet before. what's her name?,chit-chat
i assure you there is quite as much of _that_ going on in the country as in town everybody was surprised and darcy after looking at her for a moment turned silently away,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you were able to get away from her.,chit-chat
mrs bennet who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him continued her triumph i can not see that london has any great advantage over the country for my part except the shops and public places,novel
"i don't know much about mrs bennet, but i do know that she was born in london.",chit-chat
the country is a vast deal pleasanter is not it mr bingley when i am in the country he replied i never wish to leave it and when i am in town it is pretty much the same,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. how long have you been living in the country for?,chit-chat
they have each their advantages and i can be equally happy in either ay that is because you have the right disposition,novel
that's true. it's just hard to be happy when you don't get what you want.,chit-chat
but that gentleman looking at darcy seemed to think the country was nothing at all indeed mamma you are mistaken said elizabeth blushing for her mother,novel
i'm not sure what you're talking about. i don't know who elizabeth is.,chit-chat
you quite mistook mr darcy,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you referring to mr. darcy?,chit-chat
he only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town which you must acknowledge to be true certainly my dear nobody said there were but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger,novel
i don't think so. i live in a small town and i've never met anyone like that.,chit-chat
i know we dine with fourandtwenty families nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his countenance,novel
that's a good point. i don't think bingley would be able to do that.,chit-chat
his sister was less delicate and directed her eye towards mr darcy with a very expressive smile,novel
i've never seen mr darcy. what is it about him that you like so much?,chit-chat
elizabeth for the sake of saying something that might turn her mothers thoughts now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since _her_ coming away,novel

so genteel and so easy,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you saying it's easy?,chit-chat
he has always something to say to everybody,novel
that's good to hear. i'm glad he's doing well for himself.,chit-chat
_that_ is my idea of good breeding and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter did charlotte dine with you no she would go home,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by good breeding. are you referring to people who don't know what they're doing?,chit-chat
i fancy she was wanted about the mincepies,novel
oh yeah? what did she want about the mincepies? i don't get it.,chit-chat

"i don't know, i think they're pretty pretty, but i'm not sure i'd want to date them.",chit-chat

when she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my brother gardiners in town so much in love with her that my sisterinlaw was sure he would make her an offer before we came away,novel
that's really sweet of him. how long did it take for you guys to get to know each other?,chit-chat
but however he did not,novel
that's what i'm talking about. he didn't do anything to deserve it.,chit-chat
perhaps he thought her too young,novel
i don't think so. i think he just didn't know what to do.,chit-chat
however he wrote some verses on her and very pretty they were and so ended his affection said elizabeth impatiently,novel
that's so sad. i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's doing better now.,chit-chat

i hope so. it's been a long time since i've had a healthy drink.,chit-chat
everything nourishes what is strong already,novel
"that's true, but i'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing.",chit-chat
but if it be only a slight thin sort of inclination i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away darcy only smiled and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you referring to elizabeth's mother?,chit-chat
she longed to speak but could think of nothing to say and after a short silence mrs bennet began repeating her thanks to mr bingley for his kindness to jane with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy,novel
that was very nice of mr. bingley to apologize to mr. bennet for his kindness.,chit-chat
mr bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer and forced his younger sister to be civil also and say what the occasion required,novel
i'm not familiar with mr bingley. what does he do for a living?,chit-chat
she performed her part indeed without much graciousness but mrs bennet was satisfied and soon afterwards ordered her carriage,novel
that's very nice of mrs bennet. i'm sure she was very happy to hear that.,chit-chat
upon this signal the youngest of her daughters put herself forward,novel
that's a good way to look at it. it's good that she put herself forward.,chit-chat
the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit and the result of it was that the youngest should tax mr bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield,novel

that's interesting. i've never heard of that before. what kind of dinners did she serve?,chit-chat

i'm not familiar with mr bingley. what does he do for a living?,chit-chat
his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to her mothers ear,novel

i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she's feeling better and you're too.,chit-chat
oh yesit would be much better to wait till jane was well and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again,novel
that's a good point. i guess i'll have to wait and see what happens.,chit-chat
and when you have given _your_ ball she added i shall insist on their giving one also,novel
that's a good idea. i'm going to have to do that. i don't know what to do now.,chit-chat
i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not mrs bennet and her daughters then departed and elizabeth returned instantly to jane leaving her own and her relations behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mr darcy the latter of whom however could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_ in spite of all miss bingleys witticisms on _fine eyes_,novel

but do you always write such charming long letters to her mr darcy they are generally long but whether always charming it is not for me to determine it is a rule with me that a person who can write a long letter with ease can not write ill that will not do for a compliment to darcy caroline cried her brother because he does _not_ write with ease,novel
i don't always write long letters to her mr darcy they are generally long but whether always charming it is not for me to determine it is a rule with me that a person who can write a long letter with ease can not write ill that will not do for a compliment to darcy caroline because he does not write with ease,chit-chat
he studies too much for words of four syllables,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. do you have any idea what he's going to study?,chit-chat
do not you darcy my style of writing is very different from yours oh cried miss bingley charles writes in the most careless way imaginable,novel
i love miss bingley charles. she's my favorite author. what's your favorite book?,chit-chat
he leaves out half his words and blots the rest my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents your humility mr bingley said elizabeth must disarm reproof nothing is more deceitful said darcy than the appearance of humility,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to work through it.,chit-chat
it is often only carelessness of opinion and sometimes an indirect boast and which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty the indirect boast for you are really proud of your defects in writing because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable you think at least highly interesting,novel
that's a great way to put it. i'm not sure i've ever thought about it that way before.,chit-chat
the power of doing anything with quickness is always much prized by the possessor and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance,novel

when you told mrs bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort of panegyric of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else nay cried bingley this is too much to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find a new job soon.,chit-chat
and yet upon my honour i believed what i said of myself to be true and i believe it at this moment,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you say to yourself that made you believe it?,chit-chat
at least therefore i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before the ladies i daresay you believed it but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i don't think i'd ever be able to do that again.,chit-chat
your conduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any man i know and if as you were mounting your horse a friend were to say bingley you had better stay till next week you would probably do ityou would probably not goand at another word might stay a month you have only proved by this cried elizabeth that mr bingley did not do justice to his own disposition,novel
i'm not sure what you're trying to say. what do you mean by crying elizabeth?,chit-chat
you have shown him off now much more than he did himself i am exceedingly gratified said bingley by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper,novel
that's a good way to look at it. it's nice to have someone to talk to.,chit-chat
but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend for he would certainly think the better of me if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial and ride off as fast as i could would mr darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it upon my word i can not exactly explain the matterdarcy must speak for himself you expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine but which i have never acknowledged,novel
i'm not sure what you're trying to say. i don't understand.,chit-chat
allowing the case however to stand according to your representation you must remember miss bennet that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house and the delay of his plan has merely desired it asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety to yield readilyeasilyto the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit with you to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either you appear to me mr darcy to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection,novel
i don't think i've ever heard of miss bennet. what does she do?,chit-chat
a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'll have to try that.,chit-chat
i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr bingley,novel
i've never heard of mr bingley. what's his name? i'm not familiar with him.,chit-chat
we may as well wait perhaps till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon,novel
that's a good idea. i don't know if i'm ready yet.,chit-chat
but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire without waiting to be argued into it will it not be advisable before we proceed on this subject to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties by all means cried bingley let us hear all the particulars not forgetting their comparative height and size for that will have more weight in the argument miss bennet than you may be aware of,novel
i'm not sure what you're trying to say. i don't understand.,chit-chat
i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with myself i should not pay him half so much deference,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i don't think i could do that.,chit-chat
i declare i do not know a more awful object than darcy on particular occasions and in particular places at his own house especially and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do mr darcy smiled but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended and therefore checked her laugh,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense,novel
i've never heard of miss bingley. what did she say about her brother?,chit-chat
i see your design bingley said his friend,novel
that's awesome! what kind of design is it? i'm not familiar with it.,chit-chat
you dislike an argument and want to silence this perhaps i do,novel
"i don't want to silence it, but i do want to talk to her about it.",chit-chat
arguments are too much like disputes,novel
i agree. i don't think i've ever had an argument with someone i didn't like.,chit-chat
if you and miss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room i shall be very thankful and then you may say whatever you like of me what you ask said elizabeth is no sacrifice on my side and mr darcy had much better finish his letter mr darcy took her advice and did finish his letter,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by defer mine. are you referring to the fact that mr darcy didn't finish his letter?,chit-chat
when that business was over he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music,novel
that's really cool. i've never heard of miss bingley. what kind of music do you like?,chit-chat
miss bingley moved with alacrity to the pianoforte and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived she seated herself,novel
"hey there, miss bingley, how are you? i just got back from the pianoforte.",chit-chat
mrs hurst sang with her sister and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some musicbooks that lay on the instrument how frequently mr darcys eyes were fixed on her,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. it must have been very hard for her to see.,chit-chat
she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strange,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did he do to make you feel that way?,chit-chat
she could only imagine however at last that she drew his notice because there was something about her more wrong and reprehensible according to his ideas of right than in any other person present,novel
that's a good point. i don't think i'd be able to do that.,chit-chat
the supposition did not pain her,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think about it that way. i'm glad you think so.,chit-chat
she liked him too little to care for his approbation,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did she do to make you feel that way?,chit-chat
after playing some italian songs miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air and soon afterwards mr darcy drawing near elizabeth said to her do you not feel a great inclination miss bennet to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel she smiled but made no answer,novel
i'm sorry to hear that miss bennet. i hope she's doing well.,chit-chat
he repeated the question with some surprise at her silence,novel
what was the question about? i don't think i've ever heard that before.,chit-chat
oh said she i heard you before but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you say to her? what did she say to you?,chit-chat
you wanted me i know to say yes that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
i have therefore made up my mind to tell you that i do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare indeed i do not dare elizabeth having rather expected to affront him was amazed at his gallantry but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
he really believed that were it not for the inferiority of her connections he should be in some danger,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's in a better place now.,chit-chat
miss bingley saw or suspected enough to be jealous and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth,novel
"i've never seen miss bingley, but i'm familiar with her. what's her name?",chit-chat
she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest by talking of their supposed marriage and planning his happiness in such an alliance,novel

as for your elizabeths picture you must not attempt to have it taken for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes it would not be easy indeed to catch their expression but their colour and shape and the eyelashes so remarkably fine might be copied at that moment they were met from another walk by mrs hurst and elizabeth herself,novel
that's a good point. i'll have to think about that. it's hard to tell what they look like.,chit-chat
i did not know that you intended to walk said miss bingley in some confusion lest they had been overheard,novel
"oh no, that's terrible. i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay.",chit-chat

we had better go into the avenue but elizabeth who had not the least inclination to remain with them laughingly answered no no stay where you are,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get out of there.,chit-chat
you are charmingly grouped and appear to uncommon advantage,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you referring to me or my friends?,chit-chat

"wow, that's an interesting story. did you get to see any of the ladies?",chit-chat
their powers of conversation were considerable,novel
i'm not sure i've ever had a conversation with someone i didn't already know.,chit-chat
they could describe an entertainment with accuracy relate an anecdote with humour and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit,novel
that's a good way of looking at it. i'll have to think about that.,chit-chat
but when the gentlemen entered jane was no longer the first object miss bingleys eyes were instantly turned towards darcy and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think of it that way. i'll have to think about that.,chit-chat
he addressed himself directly to miss bennet with a polite congratulation mr hurst also made her a slight bow and said he was very glad but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingleys salutation,novel
that's really sweet of him. i'm sure he's a great person.,chit-chat
he was full of joy and attention,novel
that's good to hear. i'm glad he was able to make a difference.,chit-chat
the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire lest she should suffer from the change of room and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fireplace that she might be farther from the door,novel
"wow, that's a long time to be in a situation like that. what did you do?",chit-chat
he then sat down by her and talked scarcely to anyone else,novel
that's not good. i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do?,chit-chat
elizabeth at work in the opposite corner saw it all with great delight,novel
that's great! what did she do with it? did she have a good time?,chit-chat

i love cardtablebut. it's one of the most popular foods in the world.,chit-chat
she had obtained private intelligence that mr darcy did not wish for cards and mr hurst soon found even his open petition rejected,novel
"wow, that's crazy. i'm glad he didn't do anything illegal.",chit-chat
she assured him that no one intended to play and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her,novel
i don't think so. i think she was just trying to make him feel better.,chit-chat
mr hurst had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get some rest.,chit-chat
darcy took up a book,novel
what book is that? i've never heard of it. what's it about?,chit-chat
miss bingley did the same and mrs hurst principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings joined now and then in her brothers conversation with miss bennet,novel
i love miss bingley. she was such a great actress. i think she is one of the best.,chit-chat
miss bingleys attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr darcys progress through _his_ book as in reading her own and she was perpetually either making some inquiry or looking at his page,novel
i'm not familiar with mr. darcys. what's his book about?,chit-chat
she could not win him however to any conversation he merely answered her question and read on,novel
i don't think so. i think she was just trying to make him feel better about herself.,chit-chat
at length quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his she gave a great yawn and said how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way,novel
that's really nice of her. i'm sure she enjoyed it. what book was it?,chit-chat
i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading,novel

i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you can find someone to help you out.,chit-chat
she then yawned again threw aside her book and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet she turned suddenly towards him and said by the bye charles are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. what kind of dance do you do at netherfield?",chit-chat
i would advise you before you determine on it to consult the wishes of the present party i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure if you mean darcy cried her brother he may go to bed if he chooses before it begins but as for the ball it is quite a settled thing and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards i should like balls infinitely better she replied if they were carried on in a different manner but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting,novel
i think you're right. i think i'm going to talk to her about it.,chit-chat
it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day much more rational my dear caroline i dare say but it would not be near so much like a ball miss bingley made no answer and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
her figure was elegant and she walked well but darcy at whom it was all aimed was still inflexibly studious,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did she do to make you feel that way?,chit-chat
in the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more and turning to elizabeth said miss eliza bennet let me persuade you to follow my example and take a turn about the room,novel
that's really sweet of her. i'm glad you were able to get to know her better.,chit-chat
i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude elizabeth was surprised but agreed to it immediately,novel
that's great! i'm glad it worked out for you. what did she say?,chit-chat
miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility mr darcy looked up,novel
i'm not familiar with miss bingley. what's she doing that's so bad?,chit-chat
he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be and unconsciously closed his book,novel
i don't blame her. i've done that before. it's not fun.,chit-chat
he was directly invited to join their party but he declined it observing that he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down the room together with either of which motives his joining them would interfere,novel
that's not very nice of him. i'm sorry you had to go through that.,chit-chat
what could he mean,novel
i don't know... i'm not sure. i think he's just trying to make me feel better about myself.,chit-chat
she was dying to know what could be his meaningand asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him,novel
that's interesting. did you find out what he was up to at the end of the day?,chit-chat
not at all was her answer but depend upon it he means to be severe on us and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it miss bingley however was incapable of disappointing mr darcy in anything and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i don't think i've ever seen miss bingley.,chit-chat
i have not the smallest objection to explaining them said he as soon as she allowed him to speak,novel
that's not good. i'm sorry to hear that. what did she say?,chit-chat
you either choose this method of passing the evening because you are in each others confidence and have secret affairs to discuss or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking if the first i should be completely in your way and if the second i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire oh shocking cried miss bingley,novel
i love miss bingley. she was such a great character. what's your favorite show?,chit-chat
i never heard anything so abominable,novel
i don't know what i would have done if i had known it was going to happen.,chit-chat
how shall we punish him for such a speech nothing so easy if you have but the inclination said elizabeth,novel
i don't know... i'm not sure what to do about it.,chit-chat
we can all plague and punish one another,novel

but these i suppose are precisely what you are without perhaps that is not possible for anyone,novel
that's a good point. i guess i'll just have to try harder next time.,chit-chat

my temper would perhaps be called resentful,novel
that's a good way to look at it. what do you do to temper your temper?,chit-chat

i'm not familiar with mrs bennet. what does she do for a living? do you have a job?,chit-chat
her answer therefore was not propitious at least not to elizabeths wishes for she was impatient to get home,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think of it that way. i'm glad she was able to get home.,chit-chat
mrs bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday and in her postscript it was added that if mr bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer she could spare them very well,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of mr bingley before. what is he like?,chit-chat
against staying longer however elizabeth was positively resolvednor did she much expect it would be asked and fearful on the contrary of being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long she urged jane to borrow mr bingleys carriage immediately and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned and the request made,novel

i've never heard of quest of the officers. i'll have to check it out.,chit-chat
but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man whom they had never seen before of most gentlemanlike appearance walking with an officer on the other side of the way,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. i've never heard of that before. what is it about?",chit-chat
the officer was the very mr denny concerning whose return from london lydia came to inquire and he bowed as they passed,novel

that's pretty cool. i've never heard of kitty and lydia before. what kind of things do they do?,chit-chat
mr denny addressed them directly and entreated permission to introduce his friend mr wickham who had returned with him the day before from town and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps,novel
that's really nice of mr. denny. i'm sure he's a great friend.,chit-chat
this was exactly as it should be for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming,novel

his appearance was greatly in his favour he had all the best parts of beauty a fine countenance a good figure and very pleasing address,novel
that's great to hear. i'm glad he was able to achieve his goals.,chit-chat
the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversationa readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably when the sound of horses drew their notice and darcy and bingley were seen riding down the street,novel
"wow, that sounds like a lot of fun. did you have a good time with them?",chit-chat
on distinguishing the ladies of the group the two gentlemen came directly towards them and began the usual civilities,novel

bingley was the principal spokesman and miss bennet the principal object,novel
i love miss bennet. she's such a great actress. what's your favorite movie?,chit-chat
he was then he said on his way to longbourn on purpose to inquire after her,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he didn't do that.,chit-chat
mr darcy corroborated it with a bow and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger and elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting,novel
"wow, that's interesting. did you find out who was in charge of the meeting?",chit-chat
both changed colour one looked white the other red,novel
that's what i was thinking. it's crazy how color can change so much.,chit-chat
mr wickham after a few moments touched his hata salutation which mr darcy just deigned to return,novel
that's so cool! i've never heard of mr darcy. what's his name?,chit-chat
what could be the meaning of it,novel
i don't know. i'm not sure. maybe it's something i've been doing for a long time.,chit-chat
it was impossible to imagine it was impossible not to long to know,novel
"i know, right? it's been a long time since i've been in a relationship.",chit-chat
in another minute mr bingley but without seeming to have noticed what passed took leave and rode on with his friend,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you were able to find out what happened.,chit-chat
mr denny and mr wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of mr philipss house and then made their bows in spite of miss lydias pressing entreaties that they would come in and even in spite of mrs philipss throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the invitation,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. i'd like to meet mr. denny and mr. wickham.,chit-chat
mrs philips was always glad to see her nieces and the two eldest from their recent absence were particularly welcome and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home which as their own carriage had not fetched them she should have known nothing about if she had not happened to see mr joness shopboy in the street who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to netherfield because the miss bennets were come away when her civility was claimed towards mr collins by janes introduction of him,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope your nieces are doing well.,chit-chat
she received him with her very best politeness which he returned with as much more apologizing for his intrusion without any previous acquaintance with her which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice,novel
i don't think it's fair to say that he didn't do anything wrong.,chit-chat
mrs philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other of whom however she could only tell her nieces what they already knew that mr denny had brought him from london and that he was to have a lieutenants commission in the shire,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i've never read any of the books, but i'd like to.",chit-chat
she had been watching him the last hour she said as he walked up and down the streetand had mr wickham appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers who in comparison with the stranger were become stupid disagreeable fellows some of them were to dine with the philipses the next day and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr wickham and give him an invitation also if the family from longbourn would come in the evening,novel
"wow, that's quite the story. i'm sure the family would come in the evening.",chit-chat
this was agreed to and mrs philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets and a little bit of hot supper afterwards,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun! i'm sure you'll have a great time!,chit-chat
the prospect of such delights was very cheering and they parted in mutual good spirits,novel

mr collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless,novel
that's good to hear. i'm glad he didn't quit the room.,chit-chat
as they walked home elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen but though jane would have defended either or both had they appeared to be wrong she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister,novel
i don't think i've seen that happen before. what did she do to deserve that?,chit-chat
mr collins on his return highly gratified mrs bennet by admiring mrs philipss manners and politeness,novel
i'm not familiar with mrs. bennet. what does she do for a living?,chit-chat
he protested that except lady catherine and her daughter he had never seen a more elegant woman for she had not only received him with the utmost civility but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening although utterly unknown to her before,novel
that's really nice of him. i'm sure he's a great person.,chit-chat
something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's doing better now than he used to be.,chit-chat
illustration chapter xvi,novel
do you like to read? i've been reading a lot lately. it's one of my favorite books.,chit-chat
illustration as no objection was made to the young peoples engagement with their aunt and all mr collinss scruples of leaving mr and mrs bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton and the girls had the pleasure of hearing as they entered the drawingroom that mr wickham had accepted their uncles invitation and was then in the house,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. what is your favorite thing to do in your spare time?,chit-chat
when this information was given and they had all taken their seats mr collins was at leisure to look around him and admire and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification but when mrs philips understood from him what rosings was and who was its proprietor when she had listened to the description of only one of lady catherines drawingrooms and found that the chimneypiece alone had cost eight hundred pounds she felt all the force of the compliment and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeepers room,novel
"wow, that's an interesting story. i'm not familiar with lady catherines drawingrooms.",chit-chat
in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode and the improvements it was receiving he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them and he found in mrs philips a very attentive listener whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i've never heard of mrs phillips before. what do you do for a living?",chit-chat
to the girls who could not listen to their cousin and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece the interval of waiting appeared very long,novel
"wow, that sounds like a lot of fun. what instrument did you want to listen to?",chit-chat
it was over at last however,novel
that's a bummer. i'm sorry to hear that. did you have a good time?,chit-chat
the gentlemen did approach and when mr wickham walked into the room elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before nor thinking of him since with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
the officers of the shire were in general a very creditable gentlemanlike set and the best of them were of the present party but mr wickham was as far beyond them all in person countenance air and walk as _they_ were superior to the broadfaced stuffy uncle philips breathing port wine who followed them into the room,novel
i've never heard of mr wickham before. what does he do for a living?,chit-chat
illustration the officers of the shire _copyright 1894 by george allen_ mr wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation though it was only on its being a wet night and on the probability of a rainy season made her feel that the commonest dullest most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker,novel
i've never read any of george allen_'s work. what's your favorite?,chit-chat
with such rivals for the notice of the fair as mr wickham and the officers mr collins seemed to sink into insignificance to the young ladies he certainly was nothing but he had still at intervals a kind listener in mrs philips and was by her watchfulness most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin,novel
"i love coffee and muffins, but i'm not a coffee drinker.",chit-chat
when the card tables were placed he had an opportunity of obliging her in return by sitting down to whist,novel
that's very nice of him. i'm sure he appreciated it. what did you do?,chit-chat
i know little of the game at present said he but i shall be glad to improve myself for in my situation of life mrs philips was very thankful for his compliance but could not wait for his reason,novel
that's a good attitude to have. i'm sure you'll do great.,chit-chat
mr wickham did not play at whist and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia,novel
i'm not familiar with mr. wickham. what does he do for a living?,chit-chat
at first there seemed danger of lydias engrossing him entirely for she was a most determined talker but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets she soon grew too much interested in the game too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular,novel
that's interesting. i don't think i've ever won a lottery ticket.,chit-chat
allowing for the common demands of the game mr wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth and she was very willing to hear him though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told the history of his acquaintance with mr darcy,novel
elizabeth wanted to know more about mr darcy's relationship with mr wickham. what did she want to know?,chit-chat
she dared not even mention that gentleman,novel
i don't know... i'm not sure what to say to her.,chit-chat
her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved,novel
that's great! what did she find out about it? did you find out who it was?,chit-chat
mr wickham began the subject himself,novel
"have you heard of mr. wickham? he is an american singer, songwriter, and actor.",chit-chat
he inquired how far netherfield was from meryton and after receiving her answer asked in a hesitating manner how long mr darcy had been staying there,novel
"wow, that's a long time to stay at a place like that. how long did mr darcy stay there?",chit-chat
about a month said elizabeth and then unwilling to let the subject drop added he is a man of very large property in derbyshire i understand yes replied wickham his estate there is a noble one,novel
that's interesting. i'm not familiar with his estate. what did he say about it?,chit-chat
a clear ten thousand per annum,novel
"wow, that's a lot of money. do you think it's worth it?",chit-chat
you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myselffor i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy elizabeth could not but look surprised,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. how long have you been connected with your family?,chit-chat
you may well be surprised miss bennet at such an assertion after seeing as you probably might the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday,novel
"i'm not familiar with miss bennet, what does she do? i've never heard of her.",chit-chat
are you much acquainted with mr darcy as much as i ever wish to be cried elizabeth warmly,novel
"i'm not familiar with mr darcy, but i've heard of him. what's his name?",chit-chat
i have spent four days in the same house with him and i think him very disagreeable i have no right to give _my_ opinion said wickham as to his being agreeable or otherwise,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. have you tried talking to him about it? maybe he'll understand.,chit-chat
i am not qualified to form one,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. why do you not want to be a part of one?,chit-chat
i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do to make him feel that way?,chit-chat
it is impossible for _me_ to be impartial,novel
i agree. it's hard to be impartial when you don't know what you're talking about.,chit-chat
but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonishand perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure if i'd be able to express it anywhere else.,chit-chat
here you are in your own family upon my word i say no more _here_ than i might say in any house in the neighbourhood except netherfield,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad you have a good relationship with your family.,chit-chat
he is not at all liked in hertfordshire,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do to make him not like you?,chit-chat
everybody is disgusted with his pride,novel
i'm not sure if i'd be able to do it. i don't think i could do it!,chit-chat
you will not find him more favourably spoken of by anyone i can not pretend to be sorry said wickham after a short interruption that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts but with _him_ i believe it does not often happen,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i don't think i've ever heard that before.,chit-chat
the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence or frightened by his high and imposing manners and sees him only as he chooses to be seen i should take him even on _my_ slight acquaintance to be an illtempered man wickham only shook his head,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. what do you like to do in your free time?,chit-chat
i wonder said he at the next opportunity of speaking whether he is likely to be in this country much longer i do not at all know but i _heard_ nothing of his going away when i was at netherfield,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's able to come back soon.,chit-chat
i hope your plans in favour of the shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood oh noit is not for _me_ to be driven away by mr darcy,novel
i don't think so. i'm sure he'll be fine. he's a good guy.,chit-chat
if _he_ wishes to avoid seeing _me_ he must go,novel
"that's what i'm thinking, but i don't know what to do.",chit-chat
we are not on friendly terms and it always gives me pain to meet him but i have no reason for avoiding _him_ but what i might proclaim to all the worlda sense of very great illusage and most painful regrets at his being what he is,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to talk to him about it.,chit-chat
his father miss bennet the late mr darcy was one of the best men that ever breathed and the truest friend i ever had and i can never be in company with this mr darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections,novel
"i'm so sorry to hear that, mr. darcy was a great man. i hope he's doing better now.",chit-chat
his behaviour to myself has been scandalous but i verily believe i could forgive him anything and everything rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase and listened with all her heart but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to forgive him now.,chit-chat
mr wickham began to speak on more general topics meryton the neighbourhood the society appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen and speaking of the latter especially with gentle but very intelligible gallantry,novel
"hello, how are you doing today? i hope you are having a good day, mr. wickham.",chit-chat
it was the prospect of constant society and good society he added which was my chief inducement to enter the shire,novel
that's awesome. i've never been to the shire. what is it like there?,chit-chat
i know it to be a most respectable agreeable corps and my friend denny tempted me further by his account of their present quarters and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them,novel
that's really cool. i've never heard of denny before. what's their name?,chit-chat
society i own is necessary to me,novel

the church _ought_ to have been my professioni was brought up for the church and i should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now indeed yesthe late mr darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find a way to make it up to him.,chit-chat
he was my godfather and excessively attached to me,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. how long has he been with you since you met him?,chit-chat
i can not do justice to his kindness,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what kind of things do you do for a living?,chit-chat
he meant to provide for me amply and thought he had done it but when the living fell it was given elsewhere good heavens cried elizabeth but how could _that_ be,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
how could his will be disregarded,novel
i don't know. i'm not sure. it's been a while since i've seen him.,chit-chat
why did not you seek legal redress there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law,novel
"i don't know, i just didn't feel like it was worth the effort.",chit-chat
a man of honour could not have doubted the intention but mr darcy chose to doubt itor to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance imprudence in short anything or nothing,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to work things out.,chit-chat
certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago exactly as i was of an age to hold it and that it was given to another man and no less certain is it that i can not accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve to lose it,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you can find a way to get it back.,chit-chat
i have a warm unguarded temper and i may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him and _to_ him too freely,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
i can recall nothing worse,novel
what was the worst thing that happened to you? i can't recall anything like that.,chit-chat
but the fact is that we are very different sort of men and that he hates me this is quite shocking,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. do you think he's just jealous of you?,chit-chat
he deserves to be publicly disgraced some time or other he _will_ bebut it shall not be by _me_,novel
"i don't think he deserves to be publicly disgraced, but i agree with you.",chit-chat
till i can forget his father i can never defy or expose _him_ elizabeth honoured him for such feelings and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to forget him soon.,chit-chat
but what said she after a pause can have been his motive,novel
i don't know... i'm not sure. i guess i'll have to find out.,chit-chat
what can have induced him to behave so cruelly a thorough determined dislike of mea dislike which i can not but attribute in some measure to jealousy,novel
"i don't know, maybe he just doesn't like me? i'm not sure.",chit-chat
had the late mr darcy liked me less his son might have borne with me better but his fathers uncommon attachment to me irritated him i believe very early in life,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stoodthe sort of preference which was often given me i had not thought mr darcy so bad as thisthough i have never liked him i had not thought so very ill of himi had supposed him to be despising his fellowcreatures in general but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge such injustice such inhumanity as this after a few minutes reflection however she continued i _do_ remember his boasting one day at netherfield of the implacability of his resentments of his having an unforgiving temper,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
his disposition must be dreadful i will not trust myself on the subject replied wickham _i_ can hardly be just to him elizabeth was again deep in thought and after a time exclaimed to treat in such a manner the godson the friend the favourite of his father she could have added a young man too like _you_ whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable but she contented herself withand one too who had probably been his own companion from childhood connected together as i think you said in the closest manner we were born in the same parish within the same park the greatest part of our youth was passed together inmates of the same house sharing the same amusements objects of the same parental care,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get through it.,chit-chat

he was most highly esteemed by mr darcy a most intimate confidential friend,novel
"wow, that's amazing. i'm so sorry to hear that. what happened to him?",chit-chat
mr darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my fathers active superintendence and when immediately before my fathers death mr darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_ as of affection to myself how strange cried elizabeth,novel
i'm so sorry to hear about your father's death. i hope you're doing better now.,chit-chat
how abominable,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you referring to a person's abomination?,chit-chat
i wonder that the very pride of this mr darcy has not made him just to you,novel
"he hasn't made me just to you, but he has made me feel good about myself.",chit-chat
if from no better motive that he should not have been too proud to be dishonestfor dishonesty i must call it it _is_ wonderful replied wickham for almost all his actions may be traced to pride and pride has often been his best friend,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he's doing better now.,chit-chat
it has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad to hear that.,chit-chat
but we are none of us consistent and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good yes it has often led him to be liberal and generous to give his money freely to display hospitality to assist his tenants and relieve the poor,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a fan of his politics.",chit-chat
family pride and _filial_ pride for he is very proud of what his father was have done this,novel

i don't like her either. i'm not a fan of her attitude either.,chit-chat
she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune part from her authoritative manner and the rest from the pride of her nephew who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the first class elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr wickhams attentions,novel

"oh no, i'm so sorry to hear that. what happened to mr. wickham?",chit-chat
jane listened with astonishment and concern she knew not how to believe that mr darcy could be so unworthy of mr bingleys regard and yet it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham,novel
"hey jane, how are you doing today? i just got back from a long day at work.",chit-chat
the possibility of his having really endured such unkindness was enough to interest all her tender feelings and nothing therefore remained to be done but to think well of them both to defend the conduct of each and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained,novel
that makes a lot of sense. i don't think it's a good idea to do that.,chit-chat

jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends and the attentions of their brother and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr wickham and of seeing a confirmation of everything in mr darcys look and behaviour,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun! i've never heard of mr darcys before. what does he look like?,chit-chat
the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia depended less on any single event or any particular person for though they each like elizabeth meant to dance half the evening with mr wickham he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them and a ball was at any rate a ball,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. i've never heard of mr wickham before. what's his name?",chit-chat

that's a good point. i'm not sure if it's worth it though.,chit-chat
society has claims on us all and i profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for everybody elizabeths spirits were so high on the occasion that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to mr collins she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr bingleys invitation and if he did whether he would think it proper to join in the evenings amusement and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop or lady catherine de bourgh by venturing to dance,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i'm not sure i've ever heard of a lady catherine de bourgh before.",chit-chat
i am by no means of opinion i assure you said he that a ball of this kind given by a young man of character to respectable people can have any evil tendency and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours miss elizabeth for the two first dances especially a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause and not to any disrespect for her elizabeth felt herself completely taken in,novel
i'm so sorry to hear about your cousin jane. i hope she's okay.,chit-chat
she had fully proposed being engaged by wickham for those very dances and to have mr collins insteadher liveliness had been never worse timed,novel

i'm so happy for mr. collinss. he's such a great man.,chit-chat
she was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you think of what he had to say?,chit-chat
it now first struck her that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of hunsford parsonage and of assisting to form a quadrille table at rosings in the absence of more eligible visitors,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i've never heard of a quadrille table before.",chit-chat
the idea soon reached to conviction as she observed his increasing civilities towards herself and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to _her_,novel
"wow, that's interesting. how did you find out about the odds of their marriage?",chit-chat
elizabeth however did not choose to take the hint being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get it resolved.,chit-chat
mr collins might never make the offer and till he did it was useless to quarrel about him,novel
i don't think so. i think he's going to make the offer. i hope he does.,chit-chat
if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of the younger miss bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time for from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of meryton. what's it like?,chit-chat
no aunt no officers no news could be sought after the very shoeroses for netherfield were got by proxy,novel
i've never heard of proxy. what's it like? is it good?,chit-chat
even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr wickham and nothing less than a dance on tuesday could have made such a friday saturday sunday and monday endurable to kitty and lydia,novel
i'm not familiar with kitty and lydia. what's her name? i've never heard of her.,chit-chat
illustration chapter xviii,novel
do you like to read? i've been reading a lot lately and i'm really enjoying it.,chit-chat
illustration till elizabeth entered the drawingroom at netherfield and looked in vain for mr wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her,novel
"hello, how are you doing today? i just got back from a long day at netherfield.",chit-chat
the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her,novel
that's a good point. i don't think i'd be able to trust someone like that.,chit-chat
she had dressed with more than usual care and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening,novel
that's awesome! i'm so happy for you! i hope you have a great day!,chit-chat
but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr darcys pleasure in the bingleys invitation to the officers and though this was not exactly the case the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend mr denny to whom lydia eagerly applied and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before and was not yet returned adding with a significant smile i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here this part of his intelligence though unheard by lydia was caught by elizabeth and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickhams absence than if her first surmise had been just every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
attention forbearance patience with darcy was injury to wickham,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what happened to wickham? i've never heard of him.,chit-chat
she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him and turned away with a degree of illhumour which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to mr bingley whose blind partiality provoked her,novel
i've never heard of mr bingley. what does he do for a living?,chit-chat
but elizabeth was not formed for illhumour and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening it could not dwell long on her spirits and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas whom she had not seen for a week she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin and to point him out to her particular notice,novel
that's really interesting. i didn't know that elizabeth was not formed for illhumor.,chit-chat
the two first dances however brought a return of distress they were dances of mortification,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of them before. what's the name of them?,chit-chat
mr collins awkward and solemn apologizing instead of attending and often moving wrong without being aware of it gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give,novel
i'm so sorry that happened to you. i hope you're doing better now.,chit-chat
the moment of her release from him was ecstasy,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
she danced next with an officer and had the refreshment of talking of wickham and of hearing that he was universally liked,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. what did she say to the officer? did you say anything to him?",chit-chat
when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas and was in conversation with her when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr darcy who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand that without knowing what she did she accepted him,novel
"i've never heard of mr darcy, but i'm familiar with charlotte lucas. what's her name?",chit-chat
he walked away again immediately and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind charlotte tried to console her,novel
i don't think charlotte was trying to console her. she was just trying to get away from him.,chit-chat
i dare say you will find him very agreeable heaven forbid,novel
"i don't know, i'm not sure if he's a good person or not.",chit-chat
_that_ would be the greatest misfortune of all,novel
i don't know... i'm not sure i'd be able to do that.,chit-chat
to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate,novel
that's a good way to look at it. are you looking for a man who is determined to hate?,chit-chat
do not wish me such an evil when the dancing recommenced however and darcy approached to claim her hand charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man often times his consequence,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
elizabeth made no answer and took her place in the set amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr darcy and reading in her neighbours looks their equal amazement in beholding it,novel
elizabeth made no answer and took her place in the set amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr darcy and reading in their neighbors looks the equal amazement in beholding it,chit-chat
they stood for some time without speaking a word and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances and at first was resolved not to break it till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk she made some slight observation on the dance,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. i've never heard of a dance like that before.",chit-chat
he replied and was again silent,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. do you think he's going to come back?,chit-chat
after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with it is _your_ turn to say something now mr darcy,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you saying that you don't like her?,chit-chat
_i_ talked about the dance and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room or the number of couples he smiled and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a fan of the size of the room or the number of couples he smiles and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said.",chit-chat
very well that reply will do for the present,novel
i hope so. it's been a long time since i've done anything like that.,chit-chat
perhaps byandby i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones but _now_ we may be silent do you talk by rule then while you are dancing sometimes,novel
"i do talk by rule, but i don't think i'm the only one.",chit-chat
one must speak a little you know,novel
i don't know what i'm talking about. it's hard to tell sometimes.,chit-chat
it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together and yet for the advantage of _some_ conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible are you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine both replied elizabeth archly for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds,novel
"i don't think i'm gratifying my own feelings in the present, but i do think it's weird.",chit-chat
we are each of an unsocial taciturn disposition unwilling to speak unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room and be handed down to posterity with all the _éclat_ of a proverb this is no very striking resemblance of your own character i am sure said he,novel
"i'm not sure what you mean by "" unsocial taciturn disposition "".",chit-chat
how near it may be to _mine_ i can not pretend to say,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope it's not too far from where you live.,chit-chat
_you_ think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly i must not decide on my own performance he made no answer and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get to know him better.,chit-chat
she answered in the affirmative and unable to resist the temptation added when you met us there the other day we had just been forming a new acquaintance the effect was immediate,novel

a deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread his features but he said not a word and elizabeth though blaming herself for her own weakness could not go on,novel
i'm not familiar with that shade of hauteurd. what does it mean?,chit-chat
at length darcy spoke and in a constrained manner said mr,novel
i've never heard of darcy speak before. what does he say in a constrained manner?,chit-chat
wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may insure his _making_ friends whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them is less certain he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship replied elizabeth with emphasis and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life darcy made no answer and seemed desirous of changing the subject,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you are able to get through it.,chit-chat
at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room but on perceiving mr darcy he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner,novel
that was very nice of sir william lucas. did you have a good time at the set?,chit-chat
i have been most highly gratified indeed my dear sir such very superior dancing is not often seen,novel

that's a good way to look at it. it's hard to tell sometimes.,chit-chat
yes always she replied without knowing what she said for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming i remember hearing you once say mr darcy that you hardly ever forgavethat your resentment once created was unappeasable,novel
i've never heard that before. i'll have to look it up. what did she say?,chit-chat
you are very cautious i suppose as to its _being created_ i am said he with a firm voice,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i don't know what to do.,chit-chat
and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice i hope not it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion to be secure of judging properly at first may i ask to what these questions tend merely to the illustration of _your_ character said she endeavouring to shake off her gravity,novel

i do not get on at all,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. have you tried resetting your router or something?,chit-chat
i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly i can readily believe answered he gravely that reports may vary greatly with respect to me and i could wish miss bennet that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either but if i do not take your likeness now i may never have another opportunity i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours he coldly replied,novel

she said no more and they went down the other dance and parted in silence on each side dissatisfied though not to an equal degree for in darcys breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her which soon procured her pardon and directed all his anger against another,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she's able to get over it.,chit-chat
they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her so miss eliza i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham,novel
"i'm not familiar with george wickham, but i do know that he is an american actor.",chit-chat
your sister has been talking to me about him and asking me a thousand questions and i find that the young man forgot to tell you among his other communications that he was the son of old wickham the late mr darcys steward,novel
"wow, that's crazy! i've never heard of mr darcys steward before.",chit-chat
let me recommend you however as a friend not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions for as to mr darcys using him ill it is perfectly false for on the contrary he has been always remarkably kind to him though george wickham has treated mr darcy in a most infamous manner,novel
i've never heard of george wickham before. what does he do for a living?,chit-chat
i do not know the particulars but i know very well that mr darcy is not in the least to blame that he can not bear to hear george wickham mentioned and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way,novel
that's really sad. i'm glad he didn't take himself out of the way.,chit-chat
his coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing indeed and i wonder how he could presume to do it,novel
i don't know how he would do it. i'm not sure how he'd get away with it.,chit-chat
i pity you miss eliza for this discovery of your favourites guilt but really considering his descent one could not expect much better his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same said elizabeth angrily for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr darcys steward and of _that_ i can assure you he informed me himself i beg your pardon replied miss bingley turning away with a sneer,novel
i'm not sure what you're talking about. i've never accused anyone of anything.,chit-chat
excuse my interference it was kindly meant insolent girl said elizabeth to herself,novel
"oh no, that's terrible. i'm sorry to hear that. what did she say?",chit-chat
you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr darcy she then sought her eldest sister who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley,novel
i'm not sure what you're talking about. i don't even know who bingley is.,chit-chat
jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency a glow of such happy expression as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening,novel
"hey jane, how are you? i've been waiting for you to come to my house.",chit-chat
elizabeth instantly read her feelings and at that moment solicitude for wickham resentment against his enemies and everything else gave way before the hope of janes being in the fairest way for happiness,novel
i love elizabeth. she's such a great character. i'm so happy for her.,chit-chat
i want to know said she with a countenance no less smiling than her sisters what you have learnt about mr wickham,novel
"i don't know much about mr wickham, but i do know that he is a great actor.",chit-chat
but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person in which case you may be sure of my pardon no replied jane i have not forgotten him but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you,novel
i don't think i've ever thought of that. i'm not sure what you mean by that.,chit-chat
mr bingley does not know the whole of his history and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr darcy but he will vouch for the good conduct the probity and honour of his friend and is perfectly convinced that mr wickham has deserved much less attention from mr darcy than he has received and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sisters mr wickham is by no means a respectable young man,novel
i'm not familiar with mr. wickham. what does he do for a living?,chit-chat
i am afraid he has been very imprudent and has deserved to lose mr darcys regard mr,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a fan of mr. darcys.",chit-chat
bingley does not know mr wickham himself no he never saw him till the other morning at meryton this account then is what he has received from mr darcy,novel
"i don't know who mr darcy is, but i do know that i've never met him.",chit-chat
i am perfectly satisfied,novel
that's good to hear. i'm glad you're happy with your life.,chit-chat
but what does he say of the living he does not exactly recollect the circumstances though he has heard them from mr darcy more than once but he believes that it was left to him _conditionally_ only i have not a doubt of mr bingleys sincerity said elizabeth warmly but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not convinced by assurances.",chit-chat
mr bingleys defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story and has learnt the rest from that friend himself i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each and on which there could be no difference of sentiment,novel
i'm not familiar with mr bingleys. what's his defense of his friend?,chit-chat
elizabeth listened with delight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingleys regard and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it,novel
i'm so happy for you! i hope you have a wonderful day. what are you going to do?,chit-chat
on their being joined by mr bingley himself elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied before mr collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're doing well in life.,chit-chat
i have found out said he by a singular accident that there is now in the room a near relation to my patroness,novel
that's terrible. i'm sorry to hear that. how long have you been together?,chit-chat
i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh and of her mother lady catherine,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. did you find out who he was or what he said?",chit-chat
how wonderfully these sort of things occur,novel
i know right? it's amazing to think about how much we've changed over the years.,chit-chat
who would have thought of my meeting withperhapsa nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly,novel
what did you think of lady catherine de bourgh? i'm not familiar with her.,chit-chat
i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him which i am now going to do and trust he will excuse my not having done it before,novel
that's a good attitude to have. i'm glad you have a good relationship with him.,chit-chat
my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology you are not going to introduce yourself to mr darcy indeed i am,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
i shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier,novel
that's a good idea. i'm sure he'll find a way to make it up to you.,chit-chat
i believe him to be lady catherines _nephew_,novel
i've never heard of lady catherines. what does she do for a living?,chit-chat
it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday sennight elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme assuring him that mr darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom rather than a compliment to his aunt that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side and that if it were it must belong to mr darcy the superior in consequence to begin the acquaintance,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to work things out.,chit-chat
mr collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination and when she ceased speaking replied thus my dear miss elizabeth i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those which regulate the clergy for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdomprovided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained,novel
mr collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination and when she ceased speaking replied thus my dear miss elizabeth i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those which regulate the clergy for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdomprovided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained,chit-chat
you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion which lead me to perform what i look on as a point of duty,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad you're doing what you feel is right for you.,chit-chat
pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice which on every other subject shall be my constant guide though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself and with a low bow he left her to attack mr darcy whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident,novel
i'm not sure what you're trying to say. are you trying to tell me what to do?,chit-chat
her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of it she felt as if hearing it all and saw in the motion of his lips the words apology hunsford and lady catherine de bourgh it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. i've never heard of her before. what did she say?",chit-chat
mr darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder and when at last mr collins allowed him to speak replied with an air of distant civility,novel
mr darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder and when at last mr collins allowed him speak replied with an air of distant civility,chit-chat
mr collins however was not discouraged from speaking again and mr darcys contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow and moved another way mr collins then returned to elizabeth,novel
i'm not familiar with mr. collins. what's his name? i've never heard of him.,chit-chat
i have no reason i assure you said he to be dissatisfied with my reception,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
mr darcy seemed much pleased with the attention,novel
i'm not familiar with mr darcy. what's his name? i've never heard of him.,chit-chat
he answered me with the utmost civility and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of lady catherines discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily,novel
that's great! i'm glad he was able to answer the question for you.,chit-chat
it was really a very handsome thought,novel
i'm glad you enjoyed it. it's always nice to get to know someone.,chit-chat
upon the whole i am much pleased with him as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr bingley and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made her perhaps almost as happy as jane,novel
that's a great way to look at it. i'm glad you're happy with him.,chit-chat
she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow and she felt capable under such circumstances of endeavouring even to like bingleys two sisters,novel
that's interesting. i'm not familiar with bingleys. what's it about?,chit-chat
her mothers thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way and she determined not to venture near her lest she might hear too much,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm sure she feels the same way.,chit-chat
when they sat down to supper therefore she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person lady lucas freely openly and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to mr bingley,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to forgive her.,chit-chat
it was an animating subject and mrs bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match,novel
that's not good. i'm sorry to hear that. what did she do?,chit-chat
his being such a charming young man and so rich and living but three miles from them were the first points of selfgratulation and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. it must have been very difficult for him to be able to do that.,chit-chat
it was moreover such a promising thing for her younger daughters as janes marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men and lastly it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked,novel
that's very nice of her. i'm glad she was able to do that.,chit-chat
it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure because on such occasions it is the etiquette but no one was less likely than mrs bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find comfort in your life.,chit-chat
she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it,novel
i don't think i've ever heard of lady lucas before. what's her name?,chit-chat
in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mothers words or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr darcy who sat opposite to them,novel
i've never heard of mr darcy before. what does he do for a living? do you know him?,chit-chat
her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did she do to make you feel that way?,chit-chat
what is mr darcy to me pray that i should be afraid of him,novel
i don't think you should be afraid of him. he's a good guy.,chit-chat
i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing _he_ may not like to hear for heavens sake madam speak lower,novel
i don't know. i'm not sure if he's a good person or not.,chit-chat
what advantage can it be to you to offend mr darcy,novel
"i don't know, i'm not sure. i guess i just have a hard time coming to terms with it.",chit-chat
you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing nothing that she could say however had any influence,novel
that's a good point. i think i'm going to have to do that.,chit-chat
her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone,novel
that's a good way to look at it. how long have you been friends with her?,chit-chat
elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you referring to the blushing and vexation?,chit-chat
she could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr darcy though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded for though he was not always looking at her mother she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she's able to get over it.,chit-chat
the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity,novel
that's a good way to look at it. it reminds me of when i was a kid.,chit-chat
at length however mrs bennet had no more to say and lady lucas who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken,novel
i love cold ham and chicken! it's one of my favorite foods. do you like chicken?,chit-chat
elizabeth now began to revive,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you referring to elizabeth ii or elizabeth i?,chit-chat
but not long was the interval of tranquillity for when supper was over singing was talked of and she had the mortification of seeing mary after very little entreaty preparing to oblige the company,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she was able to get over the mortification.,chit-chat
by many significant looks and silent entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisancebut in vain mary would not understand them such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her and she began her song,novel
i'm not sure what you're trying to say. are you trying to tell me something?,chit-chat
elizabeths eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close for mary on receiving amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again after the pause of half a minute began another,novel
i'm so sorry you had to go through that. i hope she's better now.,chit-chat
marys powers were by no means fitted for such a display her voice was weak and her manner affected,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she's doing better now. what happened to her voice?,chit-chat
elizabeth was in agonies,novel
elizabeth was in agonies? i didn't know that. i'll have to check it out.,chit-chat
she looked at jane to see how she bore it but jane was very composedly talking to bingley,novel
that's a good point. i wonder what bingley's thoughts were on it.,chit-chat
she looked at his two sisters and saw them making signs of derision at each other and at darcy who continued however impenetrably grave,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
she looked at her father to entreat his interference lest mary should be singing all night,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
he took the hint and when mary had finished her second song said aloud that will do extremely well child,novel
that's awesome! i'm glad he took the hint. what song was it?,chit-chat
you have delighted us long enough,novel
i'm glad you think so. it's been a long time since we've been together.,chit-chat
let the other young ladies have time to exhibit mary though pretending not to hear was somewhat disconcerted and elizabeth sorry for her and sorry for her fathers speech was afraid her anxiety had done no good,novel
i don't think i would have been able to do that. i felt so bad for her.,chit-chat
others of the party were now applied to,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get in.,chit-chat
if i said mr collins were so fortunate as to be able to sing i should have great pleasure i am sure in obliging the company with an air for i consider music as a very innocent diversion and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman,novel
that's a great way to look at it. i'm glad you feel that way.,chit-chat
i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music for there are certainly other things to be attended to,novel
"that's true. i've been to a lot of concerts, but i don't get to go often.",chit-chat
the rector of a parish has much to do,novel
"that's true. i've never been to a parish, but i'd love to go one day.",chit-chat
in the first place he must make such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron,novel
i don't think so. i think he's just trying to make himself feel better about himself.,chit-chat
he must write his own sermons and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties and the care and improvement of his dwelling which he can not be excused from making as comfortable as possible,novel
i don't think so. i think he just doesn't want to admit he's wrong.,chit-chat
and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment,novel
i don't think so either. i think it's important to be attentive and conciliatory.,chit-chat
i can not acquit him of that duty nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the family and with a bow to mr darcy he concluded his speech which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room,novel
i don't think i've ever seen mr darcy before. he sounds like a great man.,chit-chat
many staredmany smiled but no one looked more amused than mr bennet himself while his wife seriously commended mr collins for having spoken so sensibly and observed in a halfwhisper to lady lucas that he was a remarkably clever good kind of young man,novel
i've never heard of mr bennet before. what does he do for a living?,chit-chat
to elizabeth it appeared that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed,novel
"i'm not sure what you mean by "" folly "", but i don't understand what you're saying.",chit-chat
that his two sisters and mr darcy however should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman or the insolent smiles of the ladies were more intolerable,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
the rest of the evening brought her little amusement,novel
that's nice. what did she do? did you have a good time with her?,chit-chat
she was teased by mr collins who continued most perseveringly by her side and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again put it out of her power to dance with others,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else and offered to introduce him to any young lady in the room,novel
i don't think so. i think she was trying to get him to do something he didn't want to do.,chit-chat
he assured her that as to dancing he was perfectly indifferent to it that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he didn't do that to her.,chit-chat
there was no arguing upon such a project,novel
that's good. i'm glad you were able to work it out. what kind of project was it?,chit-chat
she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas who often joined them and goodnaturedly engaged mr collinss conversation to herself,novel
that's really sweet of miss lucas. i'm glad she's doing well.,chit-chat
she was at least free from the offence of mr darcys further notice though often standing within a very short distance of her quite disengaged he never came near enough to speak,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i've never heard of mr darcys before.",chit-chat
she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to mr wickham and rejoiced in it,novel
"i don't know what that means, but i'm not sure what it means.",chit-chat
the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart and by a manœuvre of mrs bennet had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family,novel
that's really sweet of them. i'm glad they were able to get away.,chit-chat
mrs hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope they were able to get the house done.,chit-chat
they repulsed every attempt of mrs bennet at conversation and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party which was very little relieved by the long speeches of mr collins who was complimenting mr bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests,novel
i've never heard of mrs bennet before. what does she do for a living?,chit-chat
darcy said nothing at all,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you find someone to talk to about it.,chit-chat
mr bennet in equal silence was enjoying the scene,novel
i've never heard of mr bennet. what's he doing in equal silence?,chit-chat
mr bingley and jane were standing together a little detached from the rest and talked only to each other,novel
that must have been really hard for them to talk to each other. did they get along well?,chit-chat
elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either mrs hurst or miss bingley and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of lord how tired i am accompanied by a violent yawn,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you have a good rest of your day.,chit-chat
when at length they arose to take leave mrs bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn and addressed herself particularly to mr bingley to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time without the ceremony of a formal invitation,novel
that's really sweet of mr. bingley. i'm sure he appreciated that.,chit-chat
bingley was all grateful pleasure and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her after his return from london whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time,novel
that's so nice of him. i'm sure he was very happy for her.,chit-chat
mrs bennet was perfectly satisfied and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements new carriages and wedding clothes she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield in the course of three or four months,novel
"hello, mrs. bennet, how are you? i hope you are having a great day!",chit-chat
of having another daughter married to mr collins she thought with equal certainty and with considerable though not equal pleasure,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children and though the man and the match were quite good enough for _her_ the worth of each was eclipsed by mr bingley and netherfield,novel
i don't think i've ever heard of mr bingley. what's his name?,chit-chat
illustration to assure you in the most animated language chapter xix,novel
i'm not familiar with xix. what's it about? do you know anything about it?,chit-chat
illustration the next day opened a new scene at longbourn,novel
i've never heard of longbourn. i'll have to check it out.,chit-chat
mr collins made his declaration in form,novel
did he? i didn't see that. i'll have to look him up.,chit-chat
having resolved to do it without loss of time as his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment he set about it in a very orderly manner with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to work it out.,chit-chat
on finding mrs bennet elizabeth and one of the younger girls together soon after breakfast he addressed the mother in these words may i hope madam for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning before elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise mrs bennet instantly answered oh dear,novel
that's really sweet of you to do. i'm sure she's very happy for you.,chit-chat
yes certainly,novel
thank you so much! i really appreciate it. i'm so happy to hear that.,chit-chat
i am sure lizzy will be very happyi am sure she can have no objection,novel
"i'm sure lizzy will be very happyi, she's a great singer.",chit-chat
come kitty i want you upstairs and gathering her work together she was hastening away when elizabeth called out dear maam do not go,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope she's okay. do you think she'll be okay?,chit-chat
i beg you will not go,novel
i don't know what to do. i'm not sure if i want to go.,chit-chat
mr collins must excuse me,novel
"mr. collins is a great american singer, songwriter, and actor. do you like him?",chit-chat
he can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear,novel
that's a good way to look at it. what do you do for a living?,chit-chat
i am going away myself no no nonsense lizzy,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're feeling better. what are you going to do?,chit-chat
i desire you will stay where you are and upon elizabeths seeming really with vexed and embarrassed looks about to escape she added lizzy i _insist_ upon your staying and hearing mr collins elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction and a moments consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible she sat down again and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion,novel
i do not understand what you are trying to say. are you trying to tell me what to do?,chit-chat
mrs bennet and kitty walked off and as soon as they were gone mr collins began believe me my dear miss elizabeth that your modesty so far from doing you any disservice rather adds to your other perfections,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope that kitty and bennet had a good time.,chit-chat
you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little unwillingness but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mothers permission for this address,novel
that's very nice of you. i'm sure you're a nice person.,chit-chat
you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you saying that you don't know what you're talking about?,chit-chat
almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life,novel
why did you do that? is it because you didn't want to be the only one in the house?,chit-chat
but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marryingand moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife as i certainly did the idea of mr collins with all his solemn composure being run away with by his feelings made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther and he continued my reasons for marrying are first that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish secondly that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness and thirdly which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to work things out.,chit-chat
twice has she condescended to give me her opinion unasked too,novel
that's a bummer. i'm sorry to hear that. have you talked to her about it?,chit-chat
on this subject and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsfordbetween our pools at quadrille while mrs jenkinson was arranging miss de bourghs footstoolthat she said mr,novel
"wow, that's crazy. did you find out who she was? did you tell her?",chit-chat
collins you must marry,novel
i don't think so. i'm not sure if i want to be married or not.,chit-chat
a clergyman like you must marry,novel
my husband is a clergyman like i must marry. we have been married for 10 years.,chit-chat
choose properly choose a gentlewoman for _my_ sake and for your _own_ let her be an active useful sort of person not brought up high but able to make a small income go a good way,novel
that's a good way to think about it. i think i'll do that.,chit-chat
this is my advice,novel
what's your advice? i'm still trying to figure out what to do with my life.,chit-chat
find such a woman as soon as you can bring her to hunsford and i will visit her allow me by the way to observe my fair cousin that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer,novel
hunsford is a great place to visit. i'm sure you'll have a great time.,chit-chat
you will find her manners beyond anything i can describe and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite,novel
thank you so much for your kind words. i really appreciate it. i hope you are right.,chit-chat
thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood where i assure you there are many amiable young women,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. how do you feel about matrimony now?,chit-chat
but the fact is that being as i am to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father who however may live many years longer i could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes placewhich however as i have already said may not be for several years,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to take care of yourself.,chit-chat
this has been my motive my fair cousin and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find peace.,chit-chat
to fortune i am perfectly indifferent and shall make no demand of that nature on your father since i am well aware that it could not be complied with and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents which will not be yours till after your mothers decease is all that you may ever be entitled to,novel
that's a great way to look at it. i wish i could say the same.,chit-chat
on that head therefore i shall be uniformly silent and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i think i'll do the same.,chit-chat
you are too hasty sir she cried,novel
i don't know... i'm not sure what to do with myself.,chit-chat
you forget that i have made no answer,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. have you tried talking to a friend or family member about it?,chit-chat
let me do it without further loss of time,novel
that's a good way to look at it. what do you do for a living?,chit-chat
accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me,novel
that's a good way to look at it. it's always nice to be appreciated.,chit-chat
i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them i am not now to learn replied mr collins with a formal wave of the hand that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept when he first applies for their favour and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long upon my word sir cried elizabeth your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get through it.,chit-chat
i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time,novel
i'm not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time,chit-chat
i am perfectly serious in my refusal,novel
that's good to hear. i'm glad you're doing well in life.,chit-chat
you could not make _me_ happy and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make _you_ so,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. why do you think you're the last woman in the world?,chit-chat
nay were your friend lady catherine to know me i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation were it certain that lady catherine would think so said mr collins very gravelybut i can not imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you,novel
i don't think so. she's a good friend of mine and i'm sure she doesn't mind.,chit-chat
and you may be certain that when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty economy and other amiable qualifications indeed mr collins all praise of me will be unnecessary,novel
that's a good attitude to have. i'm sure you'll have a great time.,chit-chat
you must give me leave to judge for myself and pay me the compliment of believing what i say,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you saying you don't trust yourself?,chit-chat
i wish you very happy and very rich and by refusing your hand do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise,novel

"i'm not sure what you mean by selfreproach, but yes i did.",chit-chat
this matter may be considered therefore as finally settled and rising as she thus spoke she would have quitted the room had not mr collins thus addressed her when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character really mr collins cried elizabeth with some warmth you puzzle me exceedingly,novel
"i'm sorry, i don't understand what you're saying. what are you trying to say?",chit-chat
if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one you must give me leave to flatter myself my dear cousin that your refusal of my addresses are merely words of course,novel
that's very kind of you to say. i'm sure you'll be fine.,chit-chat
my reasons for believing it are briefly theseit does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. why do you think your hand is unworthy of your acceptance?,chit-chat
my situation in life my connections with the family of de bourgh and my relationship to your own are circumstances highly in my favour and you should take it into further consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. do you have any advice on how to deal with it?,chit-chat
your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications,novel
that's what i'm thinking. i don't know what to do with myself.,chit-chat
as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me i shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense according to the usual practice of elegant females i do assure you sir that i have no pretensions whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man,novel
i'm not serious. i don't even know what i want to do with my life.,chit-chat

i'm not sure what you're trying to say. are you trying to tell me what to do?,chit-chat

i'm so happy for mrs. bennet! i hope she's doing well.,chit-chat
mr collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character,novel

she is a very headstrong foolish girl and does not know her own interest but i will _make_ her know it pardon me for interrupting you madam cried mr collins but if she is really headstrong and foolish i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to work things out.,chit-chat
if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me because if liable to such defects of temper she could not contribute much to my felicity sir you quite misunderstand me said mrs bennet alarmed,novel

lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these,novel

that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he's doing better now.,chit-chat

that's a good point. i'm not sure if it's true though.,chit-chat
but the case is thiswe are not rich enough or grand enough for them and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother from the notion that when there has been _one_ intermarriage she may have less trouble in achieving a second in which there is certainly some ingenuity and i dare say it would succeed if miss de bourgh were out of the way,novel
i don't know about that. i'm sure she has a lot of problems.,chit-chat
but my dearest jane you can not seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy he is in the smallest degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you he is very much in love with her friend if we thought alike of miss bingley replied jane your representation of all this might make me quite easy,novel

after waiting at home every morning for a fortnight and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her the visitor did at last appear but the shortness of her stay and yet more the alteration of her manner would allow jane to deceive herself no longer,novel
that sounds like a lot of work. how long did it take for you to get home?,chit-chat
the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt my dearest lizzy will i am sure be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment at my expense when i confess myself to have been entirely deceived in miss bingleys regard for me,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to forgive her.,chit-chat
but my dear sister though the event has proved you right do not think me obstinate if i still assert that considering what her behaviour was my confidence was as natural as your suspicion,novel

i pity though i can not help blaming her,novel
i can't blame her either. i'm not sure what to do about it.,chit-chat
she was very wrong in singling me out as she did i can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. how long did it take for you to realize that?,chit-chat
but i pity her because she must feel that she has been acting wrong and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it,novel
that's a good reason to pity her. i'm sure she feels the same way.,chit-chat
i need not explain myself farther and though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless yet if she feels it it will easily account for her behaviour to me and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf is natural and amiable,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to work through it.,chit-chat

that's a good point. i don't know how long we've been together.,chit-chat

that's a great way to look at it. i'm sure she felt the same way.,chit-chat

she saw instantly that her cousins manners were not altered by his marriage his formal civility was just what it had been and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her family,novel
that's very nice of him. i'm glad he didn't break up with her.,chit-chat
they were then with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance taken into the house and as soon as they were in the parlour he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode and punctually repeated all his wifes offers of refreshment,novel
"wow, that's pretty cool. i've never heard of that before. what was it about?",chit-chat
elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room its aspect and its furniture he addressed himself particularly to her as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him,novel
"hello elizabeth, how are you doing today? i hope you are having a good day, elizabeth.",chit-chat
but though everything seemed neat and comfortable she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion,novel
that's very true. i'm glad she was able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance.,chit-chat
when mr collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed which certainly was not seldom she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotte,novel
i don't think i've seen that episode. what did she say about it?,chit-chat
once or twice she could discern a faint blush but in general charlotte wisely did not hear,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. did you ever find out why she didn't hear?,chit-chat
after sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room from the sideboard to the fender to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london mr collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden which was large and well laid out and to the cultivation of which he attended himself,novel
"wow, that must have been a very interesting experience. did you have a lot of fun?",chit-chat
to work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures and elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise and owned she encouraged it as much as possible,novel
that's really cool. i've never heard of that before. what was it about?,chit-chat
here leading the way through every walk and cross walk and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind,novel
i hate when people do that. it's so annoying. i'm sorry you have to deal with that.,chit-chat
he could number the fields in every direction and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump,novel
"wow, that's pretty cool. i'm not sure i'd be able to do that.",chit-chat
but of all the views which his garden or which the country or the kingdom could boast none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. i've never heard of such a thing before.",chit-chat
it was a handsome modern building well situated on rising ground,novel
"that's really cool. i've never been there, but i'd love to go.",chit-chat
from his garden mr collins would have led them round his two meadows but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost turned back and while sir william accompanied him charlotte took her sister and friend over the house extremely well pleased probably to have the opportunity of showing it without her husbands help,novel
that was very nice of sir william to take her over the house. he must have been so proud of her.,chit-chat
it was rather small but well built and convenient and everything was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit,novel
that's great! i'm glad it worked out for you. what was your favorite thing about it?,chit-chat
when mr collins could be forgotten there was really a great air of comfort throughout and by charlottes evident enjoyment of it elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten,novel

she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did she do to make you think she was still in the country?,chit-chat
it was spoken of again while they were at dinner when mr collins joining in observed yes miss elizabeth you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church and i need not say you will be delighted with her,novel
i've never heard of lady catherine de bourgh. what does she do for a living?,chit-chat

i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here,novel

i've never heard of her. what does she do that makes her a sensible sensible woman?,chit-chat
she is the sort of woman whom one can not regard with too much deference the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news and telling again what had been already written and when it closed elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon charlottes degree of contentment to understand her address in guiding and composure in bearing with her husband and to acknowledge that it was all done very well,novel
that's really interesting. i've never heard of her before. what is she like?,chit-chat
she had also to anticipate how her visit would pass the quiet tenour of their usual employments the vexatious interruptions of mr collins and the gaieties of their intercourse with rosings,novel
i'm not familiar with mr collins. what does he do for a living? do you know him?,chit-chat
a lively imagination soon settled it all,novel
that's great! i'm happy for you. what did you do to settle it all?,chit-chat
about the middle of the next day as she was in her room getting ready for a walk a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion and after listening a moment she heard somebody running upstairs in a violent hurry and calling loudly after her,novel
that must have been scary. did you find out who it was or did you call the police?,chit-chat

"wow, that's really interesting. i've never heard of quest of the wonder. what's it about?",chit-chat

"i don't know who she is, but i'm not a fan of her.",chit-chat
why does she not come in oh charlotte says she hardly ever does,novel
i don't know why she doesn't come in oh charlotte says she hardly ever does,chit-chat

at length there was nothing more to be said the ladies drove on and the others returned into the house,novel
"oh wow, that must have been a lot of fun. did you have a good time?",chit-chat

illustration mr collinss triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete,novel
that's great! i'm glad you were able to get in. what did you do?,chit-chat
the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife was exactly what he had wished for and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of lady catherines condescension as he knew not how to admire enough,novel
i've never heard of lady catherines condescension. what does that mean?,chit-chat
i confess said he that i should not have been at all surprised by her ladyships asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at rosings,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
i rather expected from my knowledge of her affability that it would happen,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did she do to make you feel that way?,chit-chat
but who could have foreseen such an attention as this,novel
"i don't know, but i'm glad it didn't happen to me.",chit-chat
who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there an invitation moreover including the whole party so immediately after your arrival i am the less surprised at what has happened replied sir william from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad you're able to get out of that situation.,chit-chat
about the court such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to rosings,novel

mr collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect that the sight of such rooms so many servants and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them,novel
"that's a good way to look at it, but i'm not sure i could do it.",chit-chat
when the ladies were separating for the toilette he said to elizabeth do not make yourself uneasy my dear cousin about your apparel,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay. what did he say?,chit-chat
lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and daughter,novel

i would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the restthere is no occasion for anything more,novel
that's what i'm going to do. i don't know what to do with myself.,chit-chat
lady catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed,novel
i don't think so at all. i'm not dressing up to impress anyone.,chit-chat
she likes to have the distinction of rank preserved while they were dressing he came two or three times to their different doors to recommend their being quick as lady catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of that before. what does she do for a living?,chit-chat
such formidable accounts of her ladyship and her manner of living quite frightened maria lucas who had been little used to company and she looked forward to her introduction at rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at st jamess,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're doing better now. what happened to maria lucas?,chit-chat
as the weather was fine they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park,novel
that's great! i'm glad it was a pleasant walk. what did you do?,chit-chat
every park has its beauty and its prospects and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with though she could not be in such raptures as mr collins expected the scene to inspire and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh,novel
i've never heard of sir lewis de bourgh. what does he do for a living?,chit-chat
when they ascended the steps to the hall marias alarm was every moment increasing and even sir william did not look perfectly calm,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did sir william do to make you think he was calm?,chit-chat
elizabeths courage did not fail her,novel
"i don't know what elizabeths courage is, but i'm glad she didn't fail.",chit-chat
she had heard nothing of lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue and the mere stateliness of money and rank she thought she could witness without trepidation,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope she's doing better now than she was before.,chit-chat
from the entrance hall of which mr collins pointed out with a rapturous air the fine proportion and finished ornaments they followed the servants through an antechamber to the room where lady catherine her daughter and mrs jenkinson were sitting,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun! i'm sure mrs. jenkinson had a great time.,chit-chat
her ladyship with great condescension arose to receive them and as mrs collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers it was performed in a proper manner without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary,novel
that's very nice of mrs. collins. she must be very proud of her husband.,chit-chat
in spite of having been at st jamess sir william was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow and take his seat without saying a word and his daughter frightened almost out of her senses sat on the edge of her chair not knowing which way to look,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. it must have been very difficult for her. did you have a good time?,chit-chat
elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene and could observe the three ladies before her composedly,novel
"hello elizabeth, how are you today? i'm elizabeth and i just got back from the beach.",chit-chat
lady catherine was a tall large woman with stronglymarked features which might once have been handsome,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of lady catherine. what's her name?,chit-chat
her air was not conciliating nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of that before. what is it about?,chit-chat
she was not rendered formidable by silence but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as marked her selfimportance and brought mr wickham immediately to elizabeths mind and from the observation of the day altogether she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had represented,novel
that's interesting. i'm not familiar with elizabeths mind. what's it about?,chit-chat
when after examining the mother in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of mr darcy she turned her eyes on the daughter she could almost have joined in marias astonishment at her being so thin and so small,novel
"wow, that's amazing! i've never heard of mr darcy before. what does he look like?",chit-chat
there was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
miss de bourgh was pale and sickly her features though not plain were insignificant and she spoke very little except in a low voice to mrs jenkinson in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes,novel
"i love miss de bourgh. she was an american singer, songwriter, dancer, and actress.",chit-chat
after sitting a few minutes they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view mr collins attending them to point out its beauties and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer,novel
that's really nice of mrs. collins to say that to you. what did she say?,chit-chat
the dinner was exceedingly handsome and there were all the servants and all the articles of plate which mr collins had promised and as he had likewise foretold he took his seat at the bottom of the table by her ladyships desire and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater,novel
that was very nice of mr. collins to take the seat at the bottom of the table by her ladyships desire.,chit-chat
he carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity and every dish was commended first by him and then by sir william who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his soninlaw said in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. i've never heard of sir william before. what did he say?",chit-chat
but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration and gave most gracious smiles especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. i don't think she was gratified.,chit-chat
the party did not supply much conversation,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you have to say to them about it?,chit-chat
elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening but she was seated between charlotte and miss de bourghthe former of whom was engaged in listening to lady catherine and the latter said not a word to her all the dinnertime,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that elizabeth. i hope she's doing well now.,chit-chat
mrs jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little miss de bourgh ate pressing her to try some other dish and fearing she was indisposed,novel
i love miss de bourgh. she's such a great singer and songwriter. i love her music.,chit-chat
maria thought speaking out of the question and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire,novel
maria is such a beautiful woman. i'm sure she had a great time with the gentleman.,chit-chat
when the ladies returned to the drawingroom there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk which she did without any intermission till coffee came in delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted,novel

in the intervals of her discourse with mrs collins she addressed a variety of questions to maria and elizabeth but especially to the latter of whose connections she knew the least and who she observed to mrs collins was a very genteel pretty kind of girl,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of her before. what did she say about maria and elizabeth?,chit-chat
she asked her at different times how many sisters she had whether they were older or younger than herself whether any of them were likely to be married whether they were handsome where they had been educated what carriage her father kept and what had been her mothers maiden name,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i've never heard of that before, but it sounds interesting.",chit-chat

lady catherine then observed your fathers estate is entailed on mr collins i think,novel

i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay. what did elizabeth do?,chit-chat
but i will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well,novel
"i don't know about that. she's pretty good, but she doesn't play as well as i do.",chit-chat
there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what is it about you that makes you feel that way?,chit-chat
my courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me i shall not say that you are mistaken he replied because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself and said to colonel fitzwilliam your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me and teach you not to believe a word i say,novel

i'm sorry to hear that. what did you end up doing to pass yourself off?,chit-chat
indeed mr darcy it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshireand give me leave to say very impolitic toofor it is provoking me to retaliate and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear i am not afraid of you said he smilingly,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat

i am sorry to pain you but so it was,novel
"it's okay, i'm used to it. i just don't know what to do with myself.",chit-chat
he danced only four dances though gentlemen were scarce and to my certain knowledge more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner,novel
"wow, that's a lot of dance. did you have a good time with him?",chit-chat
mr darcy you can not deny the fact i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party true and nobody can ever be introduced in a ballroom,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find someone soon.,chit-chat
well colonel fitzwilliam what do i play next,novel
i don't know. i'm not very good at video games. what do you play?,chit-chat

i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get it resolved soon.,chit-chat
shall we ask him why a man of sense and education and who has lived in the world is illqualified to recommend himself to strangers i can answer your question said fitzwilliam without applying to him,novel
i'm not sure what you're talking about. are you talking about a man of sense and education who is illqualified to recommend himself to strangers?,chit-chat
it is because he will not give himself the trouble i certainly have not the talent which some people possess said darcy of conversing easily with those i have never seen before,novel
i don't think it's talent. i think he just doesn't care.,chit-chat
i can not catch their tone of conversation or appear interested in their concerns as i often see done my fingers said elizabeth do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many womens do,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. have you tried to talk to them about something else?,chit-chat
they have not the same force or rapidity and do not produce the same expression,novel
i'm not sure what you mean. do you mean that they don't produce the same expression?,chit-chat
but then i have always supposed it to be my own faultbecause i would not take the trouble of practising,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm sure you'll do great!,chit-chat
it is not that i do not believe _my_ fingers as capable as any other womans of superior execution darcy smiled and said you are perfectly right,novel
i'm not sure if you're being facetious or if you really believe that.,chit-chat
you have employed your time much better,novel
"yes, it's been a long time since i've been able to do that.",chit-chat
no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think anything wanting,novel

i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
elizabeth immediately began playing again,novel
"elizabeth began playing again, again and again... and again, and again!!!",chit-chat
lady catherine approached and after listening for a few minutes said to darcy miss bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more and could have the advantage of a london master,novel
i'm not familiar with miss bennet. what's her name? i've never heard of her before.,chit-chat
she has a very good notion of fingering though her taste is not equal to annes,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you saying that she doesn't have a good sense of taste?,chit-chat
anne would have been a delightful performer had her health allowed her to learn elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousins praise but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley that he might have been just as likely to marry _her_ had she been his relation,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. i've never heard of miss bingley before. what's her name?",chit-chat
lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeths performance mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste,novel
i'm not familiar with lady catherine. what did she say about elizabeths performance?,chit-chat
elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyships carriage was ready to take them all home,novel

illustration elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning and writing to jane while mrs collins and maria were gone on business into the village when she was startled by a ring at the door the certain signal of a visitor,novel
"hello elizabeth, how are you doing today? i just got back from a trip to the village.",chit-chat
as she had heard no carriage she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine and under that apprehension was putting away her halffinished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions when the door opened and to her very great surprise mr darcy and mr darcy only entered the room,novel
i'm so happy for mr darcy. he's such a great man. i hope he has a great life.,chit-chat
he seemed astonished too on finding her alone and apologized for his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i don't think i could do that.,chit-chat
they then sat down and when her inquiries after rosings were made seemed in danger of sinking into total silence,novel
that's so sad. i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she's okay.,chit-chat
it was absolutely necessary therefore to think of something and in this emergency recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in hertfordshire and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure she observed how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november mr darcy,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope everything went well for you and your family.,chit-chat
it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr bingley to see you all after him so soon for if i recollect right he went but the day before,novel
that's so nice of mr. bingley. what did you do with him?,chit-chat
he and his sisters were well i hope when you left london perfectly so i thank you she found that she was to receive no other answer and after a short pause added i think i have understood that mr bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again i have never heard him say so but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future,novel
"i don't know about that, but i do know that mr. bingley is a great actor.",chit-chat
he has many friends and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing if he means to be but little at netherfield it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely for then we might possibly get a settled family there,novel
that's a good idea. i don't think i could live in a place like that.,chit-chat
but perhaps mr bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle i should not be surprised said darcy if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers elizabeth made no answer,novel
i don't think mr bingley is a good person. i think he's just a jerk.,chit-chat
she was afraid of talking longer of his friend and having nothing else to say was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to work things out.,chit-chat
he took the hint and soon began with this seems a very comfortable house,novel
that's great! i'm happy for him. it's a nice place to live.,chit-chat
lady catherine i believe did a great deal to it when mr collins first came to hunsford i believe she didand i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object mr,novel
"i've never heard of lady catherine, but i'm sure she did a great deal.",chit-chat
collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife yes indeed his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him or have made him happy if they had,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'd rather have a wife than a husband.",chit-chat
my friend has an excellent understandingthough i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr collins as the wisest thing she ever did,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. how long have you been friends with mr. collins?,chit-chat
she seems perfectly happy however and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends an easy distance do you call it,novel
i do call it that. it's been a long time since we've been together.,chit-chat
it is nearly fifty miles and what is fifty miles of good road,novel
"wow, that's a long road. i'm sure you'll be fine.",chit-chat
little more than half a days journey,novel
that's a long time to wait. i'm sure you'll be fine.,chit-chat
yes i call it a very easy distance i should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_ of the match cried elizabeth,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to win next time.,chit-chat
i should never have said mrs collins was settled _near_ her family it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find peace.,chit-chat
anything beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn i suppose would appear far as he spoke there was a sort of smile which elizabeth fancied she understood he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield and she blushed as she answered i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family,novel
i don't think that's true. i think it's more likely that he was thinking of jane and netherfield.,chit-chat
the far and the near must be relative and depend on many varying circumstances,novel
i agree. it's hard for me to get out of my comfort zone. i don't know what to do with myself.,chit-chat
where there is fortune to make the expense of travelling unimportant distance becomes no evil,novel
"that's very true. i wish i could travel more, but it's so expensive.",chit-chat
but that is not the case _here_,novel
what is not the case? i'm not sure what you're trying to say.,chit-chat
mr and mrs collins have a comfortable income but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeysand i am persuaded my friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_ the present distance mr darcy drew his chair a little towards her and said _you_ can not have a right to such very strong local attachment,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a fan of journeysand.",chit-chat
_you_ can not have been always at longbourn elizabeth looked surprised,novel
"i have never been to longbourn elizabeth, but i have heard it is a great place to visit.",chit-chat
the gentleman experienced some change of feeling he drew back his chair took a newspaper from the table and glancing over it said in a colder voice are you pleased with kent a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued on either side calm and conciseand soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister just returned from their walk,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i'm not familiar with charlotte. what is it about?",chit-chat
the _têteàtête_ surprised them,novel
i don't think i've ever heard of that person before. what's it about?,chit-chat
mr darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to anybody went away,novel
oh no! i'm so sorry to hear that. what did you say to him?,chit-chat
illustration accompanied by their aunt _copyright 1894 by george allen_ what can be the meaning of this said charlotte as soon as he was gone,novel
"i'm not sure what the meaning of the word charlotte is, but i do know that it's a song by george r. r. martin.",chit-chat
my dear eliza he must be in love with you or he would never have called on us in this familiar way but when elizabeth told of his silence it did not seem very likely even to charlottes wishes to be the case and after various conjectures they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do which was the more probable from the time of year,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find him soon.,chit-chat

that's a good way to look at it. it's hard to tell sometimes.,chit-chat
she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her but elizabeth always laughed at the idea and mrs collins did not think it right to press the subject from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt that all her friends dislike would vanish if she could suppose him to be in her power,novel

i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
he never said a great deal nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much but it struck her in the course of their third rencounter that he was asking some odd unconnected questionsabout her pleasure in being at hunsford her love of solitary walks and her opinion of mr and mrs collinss happiness and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying _there_ too,novel

younger sons can not marry where they like unless where they like women of fortune which i think they very often do our habits of expense make us too dependent and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money is this thought elizabeth meant for me and she coloured at the idea but recovering herself said in a lively tone and pray what is the usual price of an earls younger son,novel

i wonder he does not marry to secure a lasting convenience of that kind,novel

i don't think so. i think he just doesn't want to take care of himself.,chit-chat
from something that he told me in our journey hither i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him,novel
that's a good reason to think that. i'm glad you have reason to believe that.,chit-chat
but i ought to beg his pardon for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant,novel
that's a good idea. i'm sure he's going to regret it later.,chit-chat
it was all conjecture what is it you mean it is a circumstance which darcy of course could not wish to be generally known because if it were to get round to the ladys family it would be an unpleasant thing you may depend upon my not mentioning it and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley,novel
"yes, it's a circumstance. i don't know what i'm going to do about it.",chit-chat
what he told me was merely this that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage but without mentioning names or any other particulars and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer did mr darcy give you his reasons for this interference i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady and what arts did he use to separate them he did not talk to me of his own arts said fitzwilliam smiling,novel
"wow, that's pretty crazy. i'm sorry you had to go through that.",chit-chat

your cousins conduct does not suit my feelings,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i don't know what to do about it.,chit-chat
why was he to be the judge you are rather disposed to call his interference officious i do not see what right mr darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friends inclination or why upon his own judgment alone he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy,novel
i don't know... i'm not sure. i think he's just a jerk.,chit-chat
but she continued recollecting herself as we know none of the particulars it is not fair to condemn him,novel
"i don't think it's fair to condemn him, but i agree with you.",chit-chat
it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case that is not an unnatural surmise said fitzwilliam but it is lessening the honour of my cousins triumph very sadly this was spoken jestingly but it appeared to her so just a picture of mr darcy that she would not trust herself with an answer and therefore abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
there shut into her own room as soon as their visitor left them she could think without interruption of all that she had heard,novel

that's interesting. i've never heard of miss bingley before. who is she?,chit-chat

i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find peace in your life.,chit-chat
there were some very strong objections against the lady were colonel fitzwilliams words and these strong objections probably were her having one uncle who was a country attorney and another who was in business in london,novel

to jane herself she exclaimed there could be no possibility of objectionall loveliness and goodness as she is,novel

her understanding excellent her mind improved and her manners captivating,novel
that's great to hear. i'm glad you have a good relationship with her.,chit-chat
neither could anything be urged against my father who though with some peculiarities has abilities which mr darcy himself need not disdain and respectability which he will probably never reach when she thought of her mother indeed her confidence gave way a little but she would not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with mr darcy whose pride she was convinced would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friends connections than from their want of sense and she was quite decided at last that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride and partly by the wish of retaining mr bingley for his sister,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope mr. bingley is better now.,chit-chat
the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a headache and it grew so much worse towards the evening that added to her unwillingness to see mr darcy it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings where they were engaged to drink tea,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did mr darcy do to make you so angry?,chit-chat
mrs collins seeing that she was really unwell did not press her to go and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her but mr collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherines being rather displeased by her staying at home,novel

i'm not familiar with the illustration. what's it about? is it about jane?,chit-chat
they contained no actual complaint nor was there any revival of past occurrences or any communication of present suffering,novel
that's a good way to look at it. what do you think of the current state of affairs?,chit-chat
but in all and in almost every line of each there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style and which proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly disposed towards everyone had been scarcely ever clouded,novel
that's a great way to look at it. i like to think of myself as a cheerful person.,chit-chat

elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal,chit-chat
mr darcys shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a keener sense of her sisters sufferings,novel
i'm not familiar with mr darcys. what does he do for a living?,chit-chat
it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits by all that affection could do,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he's doing better now.,chit-chat
she could not think of darcys leaving kent without remembering that his cousin was to go with him but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all and agreeable as he was she did not mean to be unhappy about him,novel
i don't think colonel fitzwilliam was happy about darcys leaving. he didn't even want to be with him.,chit-chat
while settling this point she was suddenly roused by the sound of the doorbell and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself who had once before called late in the evening and might now come to inquire particularly after her,novel
"wow, that's interesting. did you find out who the colonel fitzwilliam was?",chit-chat
but this idea was soon banished and her spirits were very differently affected when to her utter amazement she saw mr darcy walk into the room,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
in a hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her health imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better,novel

"did she say something to the effect of "" oh, i'm sorry, i didn't mean to. """,chit-chat
this he considered sufficient encouragement and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately followed,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he did what he did.,chit-chat
he spoke well but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he spoke well.,chit-chat
his sense of her inferiority of its being a degradation of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding but was very unlikely to recommend his suit,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find peace in your life.,chit-chat

she tried however to compose herself to answer him with patience when he should have done,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad she didn't.,chit-chat
he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. i've never heard of that before. what is it about?",chit-chat
as he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think of that. i'm glad he won.,chit-chat
he _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety but his countenance expressed real security,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to work through it.,chit-chat
such a circumstance could only exasperate farther and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks and she said in such cases as this it is i believe the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed however unequally they may be returned,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm not sure i agree with that.,chit-chat
it is natural that obligation should be felt and if i could _feel_ gratitude i would now thank you,novel
thank you for your kind words. it's nice to have someone who feels that way.,chit-chat
but i cannoti have never desired your good opinion and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly,novel
that's very kind of you to say. thank you for your kind words. i appreciate it.,chit-chat
i am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do to make him feel that way?,chit-chat
it has been most unconsciously done however and i hope will be of short duration,novel
i hope so too. it's been a long time since i've been in a relationship.,chit-chat
the feelings which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation mr darcy who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixed on her face seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise,novel

the pause was to elizabeths feelings dreadful,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're feeling better now. what happened?,chit-chat
at length in a voice of forced calmness he said and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get through it.,chit-chat
i might perhaps wish to be informed why with so little _endeavour_ at civility i am thus rejected,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. why do you feel like you have little endeavors at all?,chit-chat
but it is of small importance i might as well inquire replied she why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will against your reason and even against your character,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you referring to the fact that she's rude to you?,chit-chat
was not this some excuse for incivility if i _was_ uncivil,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
but i have other provocations,novel

i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get through it.,chit-chat
no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_,novel
i didn't do anything to deserve it. i'm not going to do it again.,chit-chat
you dare not you can not deny that you have been the principal if not the only means of dividing them from each other of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability the other to its derision for disappointed hopes and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind she paused and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse,novel
i'm not sure what you're trying to say. are you trying to make a joke?,chit-chat
he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity,novel
that's a good way to look at it. it's nice to have a smile on your face.,chit-chat
can you deny that you have done it she repeated,novel
i don't think i can. i'm not going to lie and say i didn't do it.,chit-chat
with assumed tranquillity he then replied i have no wish of denying that i did everything in my power to separate my friend from your sister or that i rejoice in my success,novel

i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
this is the estimation in which you hold me,novel
what is the estimation in which you hold you? i'm not sure what you mean.,chit-chat
i thank you for explaining it so fully,novel
you're welcome. i'm glad i could help. it's been a long time since i've done anything like that.,chit-chat
my faults according to this calculation are heavy indeed,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do to make you feel that way?,chit-chat
but perhaps added he stopping in his walk and turning towards her these offences might have been overlooked had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design,novel
i don't think so. i think he just didn't want to be noticed.,chit-chat
these bitter accusations might have been suppressed had i with greater policy concealed my struggles and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified unalloyed inclination by reason by reflection by everything,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get through it.,chit-chat
but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what do you do for a living? do you have any hobbies?,chit-chat
nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what feelings did you have that made you feel that way?,chit-chat
they were natural and just,novel
that's good to hear. i'm glad you're happy with your body.,chit-chat
could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connectionsto congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said you are mistaken mr darcy if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner she saw him start at this but he said nothing and she continued you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it again his astonishment was obvious and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
she went on from the very beginning from the first moment i may almost say of my acquaintance with you your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance your conceit and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others were such as to form that groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry you have said quite enough madam,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get married.,chit-chat
i perfectly comprehend your feelings and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do to make you feel that way?,chit-chat
forgive me for having taken up so much of your time and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness and with these words he hastily left the room and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house,novel
that's so sweet of elizabeth. i'm so happy for her. i hope she's doing well.,chit-chat
the tumult of her mind was now painfully great,novel
i'm glad to hear that. what was the tumult of her mind like?,chit-chat
she knew not how to support herself and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. how did she learn how to support herself and from actual weakness sat down and cried?,chit-chat
her astonishment as she reflected on what had passed was increased by every review of it,novel
that's amazing! i'm so happy for her. what did you do for her?,chit-chat
that she should receive an offer of marriage from mr darcy,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. how long have you been friends with mr darcy for?,chit-chat
that he should have been in love with her for so many months,novel
"oh no, i'm sorry to hear that. did he end up breaking up with her?",chit-chat
so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friends marrying her sister and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case was almost incredible,novel
"wow, that's amazing. i'm glad you're able to relate to him.",chit-chat
it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection,novel
that's great! i'm glad you were able to relate to it. it's always nice to have a good relationship with someone you love.,chit-chat
but his pride his abominable pride his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging though he could not justify it and the unfeeling manner which he had mentioned mr wickham his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited,novel
i'm not sure if i've ever seen that movie. what's it about?,chit-chat
she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady catherines carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlottes observation and hurried her away to her room,novel
"hello, how are you doing today? i hope you are having a good day, my friend.",chit-chat
illustration hearing herself called chapter xxxv,novel
are you familiar with chapter xxxx? it's a japanese comic book series.,chit-chat
illustration elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes,novel
do you like to meditate? it's a great way to wake up in the morning.,chit-chat
she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened it was impossible to think of anything else and totally indisposed for employment she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope she's doing better now. what happened?,chit-chat
she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk when the recollection of mr darcys sometimes coming there stopped her and instead of entering the park she turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. did you get to meet mr. darcys?",chit-chat
the park paling was still the boundary on one side and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground,novel
"that's pretty cool. i've never been to a park, but i'd love to go one day.",chit-chat
after walking two or three times along that part of the lane she was tempted by the pleasantness of the morning to stop at the gates and look into the park,novel
that's really nice of her. i'm sure she didn't feel bad about it.,chit-chat
the five weeks which she had now passed in kent had made a great difference in the country and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. it's hard to lose someone you love.,chit-chat
she was on the point of continuing her walk when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park he was moving that way and fearful of its being mr darcy she was directly retreating,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i've never heard of mr darcy before. what does he look like?",chit-chat
but the person who advanced was now near enough to see her and stepping forward with eagerness pronounced her name,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think of that. i'm glad she was able to see her.,chit-chat
she had turned away but on hearing herself called though in a voice which proved it to be mr darcy she moved again towards the gate,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. what did she do to prove it to be mr darcy?",chit-chat
he had by that time reached it also and holding out a letter which she instinctively took said with a look of haughty composure i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you,novel
that's really nice of you to do. i'm sure you'll have a great time.,chit-chat
will you do me the honour of reading that letter and then with a slight bow turned again into the plantation and was soon out of sight,novel
i'll do you the honor of reading that letter and then with a slight bow turned again into the plantation and was soon out of sight,chit-chat
with no expectation of pleasure but with the strongest curiosity elizabeth opened the letter and to her still increasing wonder perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper written quite through in a very close hand,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. what did you do with it? did you find out who it was?",chit-chat
the envelope itself was likewise full,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get it back soon.,chit-chat
pursuing her way along the lane she then began it,novel
that's a good way to look at it. what did she do to get away?,chit-chat
it was dated from rosings at eight oclock in the morning and was as follows be not alarmed madam on receiving this letter by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to you,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get it fixed.,chit-chat
i write without any intention of paining you or humbling myself by dwelling on wishes which for the happiness of both can not be too soon forgotten and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion should have been spared had not my character required it to be written and read,novel
that's a great way to think about it. i'm sure you're a great writer.,chit-chat
you must therefore pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention your feelings i know will bestow it unwillingly but i demand it of your justice,novel
"i'm sorry, i don't understand what you're saying. what do you mean?",chit-chat
two offences of a very different nature and by no means of equal magnitude you last night laid to my charge,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to pay them back.,chit-chat
the first mentioned was that regardless of the sentiments of either i had detached mr bingley from your sisterand the other that i had in defiance of various claims in defiance of honour and humanity ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of mr wickham,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope mr. wickham has a good life.,chit-chat
wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth the acknowledged favourite of my father a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage and who had been brought up to expect its exertion would be a depravity to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks could bear no comparison,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed respecting each circumstance i shall hope to be in future secured when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read,novel
i'm sorry you had to go through that. i hope you're doing better now.,chit-chat
if in the explanation of them which is due to myself i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours i can only say that i am sorry,novel
i don't think it's offensive at all. i'm not sure what you mean by that.,chit-chat
the necessity must be obeyed and further apology would be absurd,novel
that's what i'm thinking. i don't know what to do now.,chit-chat
i had not been long in hertfordshire before i saw in common with others that bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
i had often seen him in love before,novel
what did you see him in love with? i'm sure you'll see him again.,chit-chat
at that ball while i had the honour of dancing with you i was first made acquainted by sir william lucass accidental information that bingleys attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage,novel
"oh wow, that's really interesting. i'm sorry to hear that. what happened?",chit-chat
he spoke of it as a certain event of which the time alone could be undecided,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm not sure i could do that.,chit-chat
from that moment i observed my friends behaviour attentively and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him,novel
what did miss bennet do to make you think she was a good friend? i've never met her.,chit-chat
your sister i also watched,novel
oh really? what was the name of the movie? i can't seem to find it.,chit-chat
her look and manners were open cheerful and engaging as ever but without any symptom of peculiar regard and i remained convinced from the evenings scrutiny that though she received his attentions with pleasure she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
if _you_ have not been mistaken here _i_ must have been in an error,novel
"that's what i'm thinking, but i don't know what to do.",chit-chat
your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable,novel
"i think so, but i'm not sure if it's a good idea to tell her.",chit-chat
if it be so if i have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her your resentment has not been unreasonable,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
but i shall not scruple to assert that the serenity of your sisters countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that however amiable her temper her heart was not likely to be easily touched,novel
i don't think you should scruple. i'm not sure what you mean by that.,chit-chat
that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain but i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears,novel
that's a good way to look at it. it's always good to be open about your feelings.,chit-chat
i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it i believed it on impartial conviction as truly as i wished it in reason,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to come to terms with it.,chit-chat
my objections to the marriage were not merely those which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get through it.,chit-chat
but there were other causes of repugnance causes which though still existing and existing to an equal degree in both instances i had myself endeavoured to forget because they were not immediately before me,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm not sure i could do that.,chit-chat
these causes must be stated though briefly,novel
"i'm not sure what causes them, but i do know it's not good for my health.",chit-chat
the situation of your mothers family though objectionable was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently so almost uniformly betrayed by herself by your three younger sisters and occasionally even by your fatherpardon meit pains me to offend you,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i don't know what i would do without my sisters.,chit-chat
but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations and your displeasure at this representation of them let it give you consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both,novel
that's a good point. i think i'm going to have to do that.,chit-chat
i will only say farther that from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed and every inducement heightened which could have led me before to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
he left netherfield for london on the day following as you i am certain remember with the design of soon returning,novel
"that's right, he left for london on the day following as i am certain with the design of soon return.",chit-chat
the part which i acted is now to be explained,novel
why did you act that way? did you have to explain it to your boss or something?,chit-chat
his sisters uneasiness had been equally excited with my own our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered and alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london,novel
that's really nice of you. i'm glad you were able to connect with him.,chit-chat
we accordingly wentand there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to talk to your friend about it.,chit-chat
i described and enforced them earnestly,novel
that's a good thing to do. i'm not sure i could do that.,chit-chat
but however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage had it not been seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving of your sisters indifference,novel
that's a good point. i think i'm going to talk to him about it.,chit-chat
he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere if not with equal regard,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i don't think i could do that.,chit-chat
but bingley has great natural modesty with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get through it.,chit-chat
to convince him therefore that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm not sure i could do that.,chit-chat
to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire when that conviction had been given was scarcely the work of a moment,novel
"wow, that's really impressive. what did you do to convince him to do that?",chit-chat
i can not blame myself for having done thus much,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do that made you feel that way?,chit-chat
there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which i do not reflect with satisfaction it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sisters being in town,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
i knew it myself as it was known to miss bingley but her brother is even yet ignorant of it,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
that they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps probable but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
perhaps this concealment this disguise was beneath me,novel
that's a good way to look at it. what did you do to deserve it?,chit-chat
it is done however and it was done for the best,novel
"that's true, but i'm not sure if i'll be able to do it.",chit-chat
on this subject i have nothing more to say no other apology to offer,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
if i have wounded your sisters feelings it was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient i have not yet learnt to condemn themwith respect to that other more weighty accusation of having injured mr wickham i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to forgive your sister.,chit-chat
of what he has _particularly_ accused me i am ignorant but of the truth of what i shall relate i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to come to terms with it.,chit-chat
mr wickham is the son of a very respectable man who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him and on george wickham who was his godson his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. i've never heard of george wickham before.",chit-chat
my father supported him at school and afterwards at cambridge most important assistance as his own father always poor from the extravagance of his wife would have been unable to give him a gentlemans education,novel
that's so sad. i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's doing better now.,chit-chat
my father was not only fond of this young mans society whose manners were always engaging he had also the highest opinion of him and hoping the church would be his profession intended to provide for him in it,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did he do to make you feel that way?,chit-chat
as for myself it is many many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. how long have you been thinking of him since then?,chit-chat
the vicious propensities the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments which mr darcy could not have,novel
"i've never seen mr darcy, but i'm familiar with the film. what's it about?",chit-chat
here again i shall give you painto what degree you only can tell,novel
i'm not sure what i want to do with my degree. i don't want to go back to school.,chit-chat
but whatever may be the sentiments which mr wickham has created a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character,novel
i'm not familiar with mr. wickham. what does he do for a living?,chit-chat
it adds even another motive,novel
"i know, it's so annoying. i don't know what i'm going to do.",chit-chat
my excellent father died about five years ago and his attachment to mr wickham was to the last so steady that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow and if he took orders desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant,novel
i'm so sorry to hear about your father's loss. i hope he's doing well now.,chit-chat
there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds,novel
"wow, that's a lot of weight. i've never heard of that before.",chit-chat
his own father did not long survive mine and within half a year from these events mr wickham wrote to inform me that having finally resolved against taking orders he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage in lieu of the preferment by which he could not be benefited,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get through it.,chit-chat
he had some intention he added of studying the law and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to pay him back.,chit-chat
i rather wished than believed him to be sincere but at any rate was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. how long did it take for him to say yes?,chit-chat
i knew that mr wickham ought not to be a clergyman,novel
i didn't know he was a clergyman. i thought he was an actor.,chit-chat
the business was therefore soon settled,novel
that's good to hear. how long did it take for the business to be settled?,chit-chat
he resigned all claim to assistance in the church were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it and accepted in return three thousand pounds,novel
"wow, that's a lot of money. i'm glad he's doing well.",chit-chat
all connection between us seemed now dissolved,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. do you think you'll be able to get back together?,chit-chat
i thought too ill of him to invite him to pemberley or admit his society in town,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do to make him feel that way?,chit-chat
in town i believe he chiefly lived but his studying the law was a mere pretence and being now free from all restraint his life was a life of idleness and dissipation,novel
that's so sad. i'm sorry to hear that. what happened to him?,chit-chat
for about three years i heard little of him but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him he applied to me again by letter for the presentation,novel
"wow, that's really cool. what kind of presentation was it? did you get the job?",chit-chat
his circumstances he assured me and i had no difficulty in believing it were exceedingly bad,novel
that's good to hear. i'm glad you had a good relationship with him.,chit-chat
he had found the law a most unprofitable study and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained if i would present him to the living in questionof which he trusted there could be little doubt as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for and i could not have forgotten my revered fathers intentions,novel
that's really sweet of you. i'm glad he's doing well now.,chit-chat
you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty or for resisting every repetition of it,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstancesand he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get away from him.,chit-chat
after this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropped,novel
"wow, that must have been very stressful. did you have to go to the hospital?",chit-chat
how he lived i know not,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find out how he lived.,chit-chat
but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice,novel
that's not good. did you tell him that you didn't want to work there?,chit-chat
i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to forget about it.,chit-chat
having said thus much i feel no doubt of your secrecy,novel
thank you so much! i really appreciate it. i'm so proud of him. he's my best friend.,chit-chat
my sister who is more than ten years my junior was left to the guardianship of my mothers nephew colonel fitzwilliam and myself,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find him.,chit-chat
about a year ago she was taken from school and an establishment formed for her in london and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it to ramsgate and thither also went mr wickham undoubtedly by design for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs younge in whose character we were most unhappily deceived and by her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to georgiana whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child that she was persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. i've never heard of mrs younge before.",chit-chat
she was then but fifteen which must be her excuse and after stating her imprudence i am happy to add that i owed the knowledge of it to herself,novel
that's a good attitude to have. i'm glad you were able to learn from her.,chit-chat
i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement and then georgiana unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father acknowledged the whole to me,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
you may imagine what i felt and how i acted,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do to make you feel that way?,chit-chat
regard for my sisters credit and feelings prevented any public exposure but i wrote to mr wickham who left the place immediately and mrs younge was of course removed from her charge,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get it resolved.,chit-chat
mr wickhams chief object was unquestionably my sisters fortune which is thirty thousand pounds but i can not help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement,novel
"wow, that's a lot of money. i'm sorry to hear that. what did she do with it?",chit-chat
his revenge would have been complete indeed,novel
i think so too. i was so mad at him. i felt so bad for him.,chit-chat
this madam is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together and if you do not absolutely reject it as false you will i hope acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards mr wickham,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find peace.,chit-chat
i know not in what manner under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either,novel
thank you for your kind words. it's nice to have someone to talk to about it.,chit-chat
detection could not be in your power and suspicion certainly not in your inclination,novel
that's what i was thinking. i'm not sure what to do about it.,chit-chat
you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure why i didn't tell her.,chit-chat
but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do to get better at the game?,chit-chat
for the truth of everything here related i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam who from our near relationship and constant intimacy and still more as one of the executors of my fathers will has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get through it.,chit-chat
if your abhorrence of _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless you can not be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin and that there may be the possibility of consulting him i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning,novel
that's a good idea. i'm not sure if i could do that though.,chit-chat
i will only add god bless you,novel
thank you so much! i'm so happy to hear that. i hope you have a wonderful day!,chit-chat
fitzwilliam darcy illustration chapter xxxvi,novel
have you ever read xxx? it's my favorite book of all time. have you read it?,chit-chat
illustration elizabeth when mr darcy gave her the letter did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers she had formed no expectation at all of its contents,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. what did mr darcy say to mr. darcy?,chit-chat
but such as they were it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them and what a contrariety of emotion they excited,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure what to do about it. i guess i'll just have to deal with it.,chit-chat
her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to talk to her about it.,chit-chat
with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give which a just sense of shame would not conceal,novel
"that's a good question. i'm not sure, but i think it's possible.",chit-chat
with a strong prejudice against everything he might say she began his account of what had happened at netherfield,novel
i don't think so. i'm not sure what happened at netherfield.,chit-chat
she read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
his belief of her sisters insensibility she instantly resolved to be false and his account of the real the worst objections to the match made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her his style was not penitent but haughty,novel

but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr wickhamwhen she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which if true must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himselfher feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition,novel
i'm not familiar with mr wickhamwhen's account. what's it about?,chit-chat
astonishment apprehension and even horror oppressed her,novel
"i don't know what astonishment hension is, but it sounds interesting.",chit-chat
she wished to discredit it entirely repeatedly exclaiming this must be false,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you saying that she's lying?,chit-chat
this can not be,novel
it can't be. i'm going to be so sad when it's over.,chit-chat
this must be the grossest falsehoodand when she had gone through the whole letter though scarcely knowing anything of the last page or two put it hastily away protesting that she would not regard it that she would never look in it again,novel
i can't imagine what it must have been like for her to go through the whole letter.,chit-chat
in this perturbed state of mind with thoughts that could rest on nothing she walked on but it would not do in half a minute the letter was unfolded again and collecting herself as well as she could she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence,novel
i've never heard of wickham before. what is it about him that you find so interesting?,chit-chat
the account of his connection with the pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself and the kindness of the late mr darcy though she had not before known its extent agreed equally well with his own words,novel
i'm not familiar with the pemberley family. what's it about?,chit-chat
so far each recital confirmed the other but when she came to the will the difference was great,novel
that's great! how long did it take for the recital to go to the will?,chit-chat
what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory and as she recalled his very words it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other and for a few moments she flattered herself that her wishes did not err,novel
that's really interesting. i've never heard of wickham before. who is she?,chit-chat
but when she read and reread with the closest attention the particulars immediately following of wickhams resigning all pretensions to the living of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds again was she forced to hesitate,novel
"wow, that's a lot of money. what did wickhams do with it?",chit-chat
she put down the letter weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartialitydeliberated on the probability of each statementbut with little success,novel

"that's true, but i still feel bad about it. i don't know what to do now.",chit-chat
again she read on,novel
i love to read. it's one of my favorite things to do. what's your favorite book?,chit-chat
but every line proved more clearly that the affair which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render mr darcys conduct in it less than infamous was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole,novel
"that's a good point. i didn't think about it that way, but you're right.",chit-chat
the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to mr wickhams charge exceedingly shocked her the more so as she could bring no proof of its injustice,novel

that's interesting. i'm not familiar with mr darcy. what's he like?,chit-chat
but no such recollection befriended her,novel
i don't think so. i'm not sure if she's still around.,chit-chat
she could see him instantly before her in every charm of air and address but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess,novel
that's a great way to look at it. i think it's great that she's able to see him in every charm of air and address.,chit-chat

i've never heard of miss darcy. i'll have to look into it more.,chit-chat
at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal if he had not been well assured of his cousins corroboration,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get it resolved.,chit-chat

that's good to hear. i'm glad he's doing well for himself.,chit-chat
she was _now_ struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger and wondered it had escaped her before,novel
that's really interesting. did you find out who it was or did you just assume it was someone you knew?,chit-chat

how differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned,novel
it was a lot different. i felt like i was in a different world than he was.,chit-chat
his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes but his eagerness to grasp at anything,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shown,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure what to make of his behavior.,chit-chat
every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter and in further justification of mr darcy she could not but allow that mr bingley when questioned by jane had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affairthat proud and repulsive as were his manners she had never in the whole course of their acquaintancean acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together and given her a sort of intimacy with his waysseen anything that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjustanything that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habitsthat among his own connections he was esteemed and valuedthat even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feelingthat had his actions been what wickham represented them so gross a violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world and that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man as mr bingley was incomprehensible,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're doing better than that.,chit-chat
she grew absolutely ashamed of herself,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did she do to make you feel that way?,chit-chat
of neither darcy nor wickham could she think without feeling that she had been blind partial prejudiced absurd,novel

i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's able to get over it.,chit-chat
neither could she deny the justice of his description of jane,novel
i don't think so. i think she's a bit of a hypocrite.,chit-chat
she felt that janes feelings though fervent were little displayed and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner not often united with great sensibility,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm sure she feels the same way.,chit-chat
when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned in tones of such mortifying yet merited reproach her sense of shame was severe,novel
i can't imagine what it must have been like to be in that situation. i'm sorry you had to go through that.,chit-chat
the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as having passed at the netherfield ball and as confirming all his first disapprobation could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers,novel
"i don't know about you, but i've never been in a situation like that.",chit-chat
the compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt,novel
that's really nice of her. what did you do to make her feel better about herself?,chit-chat
it soothed but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus selfattracted by the rest of her family and as she considered that janes disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct she felt depressed beyond anything she had ever known before,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get through it.,chit-chat
after wandering along the lane for two hours giving way to every variety of thought reconsidering events determining probabilities and reconciling herself as well as she could to a change so sudden and so important fatigue and a recollection of her long absence made her at length return home and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation,novel
"wow, that must have been a long day. did you have a good time with her?",chit-chat
she was immediately told that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence mr darcy only for a few minutes to take leave but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour hoping for her return and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found,novel
"wow, that's a long time to wait. i'm glad she's okay.",chit-chat

that's pretty cool. i'm glad he didn't do that to her.,chit-chat

it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for longbourn before she told her sister of mr darcys proposals,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
to know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish jane and must at the same time so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate and her fear if she once entered on the subject of being hurried into repeating something of bingley which might only grieve her sister further,novel
that's a very interesting way to look at it. i've never heard of that power before.,chit-chat

wickham is safe and mary king is safe added elizabeth safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune she is a great fool for going away if she liked him but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side said jane,novel

in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to meryton and see how everybody went on but elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme,novel

that's interesting. i didn't know that. do you know who elizabeth is?,chit-chat
illustration chapter xl,novel
do you like to read? i've been reading a lot lately and i'm really enjoying it.,chit-chat
illustration elizabeths impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned and preparing her to be surprised she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr darcy and herself,novel
"i've never read illustration elizabeths, but i'm familiar with it. what's your favorite illustration?",chit-chat
miss bennets astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings,novel
i have never heard of miss bennet astonishment. what does she do for a living?,chit-chat
she was sorry that mr darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sisters refusal must have given him,novel
i don't think she was sorry at all. she just didn't like him.,chit-chat
his being so sure of succeeding was wrong said she and certainly ought not to have appeared but consider how much it must increase his disappointment indeed replied elizabeth i am heartily sorry for him but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me,novel

what a stroke was this for poor jane who would willingly have gone through the world without believing so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here collected in one individual,chit-chat
nor was darcys vindication though grateful to her feelings capable of consoling her for such discovery,novel
"that's a good point, i didn't think of it that way. i'm glad she was able to share that with him.",chit-chat
most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error and seek to clear one without involving the other,novel

this will not do said elizabeth you never will be able to make both of them good for anything,novel
i don't know... i'm not sure if i'll ever be able to make both of them good.,chit-chat

that's a good point. i'm not sure if i'll ever be able to be a good man.,chit-chat
for my part i am inclined to believe it all mr darcys but you shall do as you choose it was some time however before a smile could be extorted from jane,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm sure you're right.,chit-chat
i do not know when i have been more shocked said she,novel
"what did she say? i'm so happy for you, i hope she's doing well.",chit-chat
wickham so very bad,novel
i'm not sure if i've ever heard of wickham. what's his name?,chit-chat
it is almost past belief,novel

that's so sweet of you to say. i'm so happy to hear that.,chit-chat
there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance,novel
i know right? i can't wait to see what he's going to do next.,chit-chat
such an openness and gentleness in his manner there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men,novel
i agree. it's a shame that he didn't learn from the mistakes he made.,chit-chat
one has got all the goodness and the other all the appearance of it i never thought mr darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you used to do and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him without any reason,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
it is such a spur to ones genius such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind,novel
i don't think it's a spur of the moment thing. i'm not a fan of it.,chit-chat
one may be continually abusive without saying anything just but one can not be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty lizzy when you first read that letter i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now indeed i could not,novel
that's so true. i can't even imagine what it must be like to be in that situation.,chit-chat
i was uncomfortable enough i was very uncomfortablei may say unhappy,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
and with no one to speak to of what i felt no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you can find someone to talk to soon.,chit-chat
oh how i wanted you how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to mr darcy for now they _do_ appear wholly undeserved certainly,novel
i don't know what i would do without mr. darcy. he's my best friend.,chit-chat
but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
there is one point on which i want your advice,novel
what is the one point on which you want to tell me? i'm not sure what you mean.,chit-chat
i want to be told whether i ought or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand wickhams character miss bennet paused a little and then replied surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully,novel
i don't think i've ever seen miss bennet. what did she do?,chit-chat
what is your own opinion that it ought not to be attempted,novel
i don't think it's a good idea. i'm not sure if i can do it.,chit-chat
mr darcy has not authorized me to make his communication public,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. have you tried contacting mr. darcy about it?,chit-chat
on the contrary every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct who will believe me,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get through it.,chit-chat
the general prejudice against mr darcy is so violent that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light,novel
i don't think i've ever seen that movie. what's it about?,chit-chat
i am not equal to it,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what do you do for a living? do you have any hobbies?,chit-chat
wickham will soon be gone and therefore it will not signify to anybody here what he really is,novel
"i don't know who wickham is, but i'm not familiar with him.",chit-chat
some time hence it will be all found out and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before,novel
that's what i'm worried about. i don't know what to do.,chit-chat
at present i will say nothing about it you are quite right,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad you think so.,chit-chat
to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever,novel
that's what i'm worried about. i don't know what to do.,chit-chat
he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done and anxious to reestablish a character,novel
that's what i'm thinking too. i don't know what to do.,chit-chat
we must not make him desperate the tumult of elizabeths mind was allayed by this conversation,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to work it out.,chit-chat
she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight and was certain of a willing listener in jane whenever she might wish to talk again of either,novel
that's interesting. what secrets did she get rid of? i'm not familiar with jane.,chit-chat
but there was still something lurking behind of which prudence forbade the disclosure,novel
what did prudence forbade the disclosure to do? i don't think i've heard of that.,chit-chat
she dared not relate the other half of mr darcys letter nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did she say to mr darcys letter?,chit-chat

the rapture of lydia on this occasion her adoration of mrs forster the delight of mrs bennet and the mortification of kitty are scarcely to be described,novel
"i've never heard of lydia, but i'm familiar with her. what's her name?",chit-chat
wholly inattentive to her sisters feelings lydia flew about the house in restless ecstasy calling for everyones congratulations and laughing and talking with more violence than ever whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay. i'll pray for you.,chit-chat
i can not see why mrs forster should not ask _me_ as well as lydia said she though i am _not_ her particular friend,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure why she didn't ask.,chit-chat
i have just as much right to be asked as she has and more too for i am two years older in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable and jane to make her resigned,novel
i don't think so. i think she's just trying to keep her job.,chit-chat
as for elizabeth herself this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia that she considered it as the deathwarrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter and detestable as such a step must make her were it known she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go,novel
i don't know if i agree with that. i think it's important to have common sense in your life.,chit-chat
she represented to him all the improprieties of lydias general behaviour the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mrs forster and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton where the temptations must be greater than at home,novel
i don't think i've ever heard of mrs forster before. what's her name?,chit-chat
he heard her attentively and then said lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances if you were aware said elizabeth of the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of lydias unguarded and imprudent manner nay which has already arisen from it i am sure you would judge differently in the affair already arisen repeated mr bennet,novel

her character will be fixed and she will at sixteen be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculousa flirt too in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a fan of her character.",chit-chat
in this danger kitty is also comprehended,novel
i've never heard of hended kitty. i'll have to check it out.,chit-chat

i don't think so. i think she's going to follow her own path.,chit-chat
vain ignorant idle and absolutely uncontrolled,novel
i don't think i've ever heard of vain ignorant. what does that mean?,chit-chat

i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find peace with your father.,chit-chat
wherever you and jane are known you must be respected and valued and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple ofor i may say threevery silly sisters,novel

colonel forster is a sensible man and will keep her out of any real mischief and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody,novel
colonel forster is a good man. i think he is a bit of a hypocrite though.,chit-chat
at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here,novel
i don't think so. i'm sure she'll have a great time.,chit-chat
the officers will find women better worth their notice,novel
i don't think so. i'm sure they'll find a way to get away with it.,chit-chat
let us hope therefore that her being there may teach her her own insignificance,novel
"that's what i'm trying to do, but i don't know what to do.",chit-chat
at any rate she can not grow many degrees worse without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content but her own opinion continued the same and she left him disappointed and sorry,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
it was not in her nature however to increase her vexations by dwelling on them,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i think it's important to do that.,chit-chat
she was confident of having performed her duty and to fret over unavoidable evils or augment them by anxiety was no part of her disposition,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. that must have been very difficult for her and lydia.,chit-chat
in lydias imagination a visit to brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness,novel
that's really interesting. i've never heard of that before. what is it about?,chit-chat
she saw with the creative eye of fancy the streets of that gay bathingplace covered with officers,novel
"i've never been to a gay bathingplace, but i'd love to go one day.",chit-chat
she saw herself the object of attention to tens and to scores of them at present unknown,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad you're able to relate to her.,chit-chat
she saw all the glories of the camp its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines crowded with the young and the gay and dazzling with scarlet and to complete the view she saw herself seated beneath a tent tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once,novel
"hello, how are you doing today? i just got back from a long day at work.",chit-chat
illustration tenderly flirting _copyright 1894 by george allen_ had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these what would have been her sensations,novel
i'm not familiar with george allen_. what does he do for a living?,chit-chat
they could have been understood only by her mother who might have felt nearly the same,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think of that. it's true.,chit-chat
lydias going to brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husbands never intending to go there himself,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i don't know what happened to her husband.,chit-chat
but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of lydias leaving home,novel
that's a good point. it's hard to believe that they didn't know what was going to happen.,chit-chat
elizabeth was now to see mr wickham for the last time,novel
that's awesome! i've never seen mr. wickham. what's his name?,chit-chat
having been frequently in company with him since her return agitation was pretty well over the agitations of former partiality entirely so,novel
that's good to hear. it's always good to have a good relationship with someone.,chit-chat
she had even learnt to detect in the very gentleness which had first delighted her an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary,novel
that's great! i'm glad she was able to learn from her mistakes. what was the affectation about?,chit-chat
in his present behaviour to herself moreover she had a fresh source of displeasure for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve after what had since passed to provoke her,novel
"wow, that's pretty crazy. i'm sorry you had to go through that.",chit-chat
she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry and while she steadily repressed it could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing that however long and for whatever cause his attentions had been withdrawn her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i've never heard of that before. what is it about?",chit-chat
on the very last day of the regiments remaining in meryton he dined with others of the officers at longbourn and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in goodhumour that on his making some inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford she mentioned colonel fitzwilliams and mr darcys having both spent three weeks at rosings and asked him if he were acquainted with the former,novel
"that's really interesting. i've never been to hunsford, but i'd love to go.",chit-chat
he looked surprised displeased alarmed but with a moments recollection and a returning smile replied that he had formerly seen him often and after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man asked her how she had liked him,novel
"wow, that's pretty interesting. did you have a good time with him, or was it a bad time?",chit-chat
her answer was warmly in his favour,novel
what was her answer? i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you referring to something else?,chit-chat
with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added how long did you say that he was at rosings nearly three weeks and you saw him frequently yes almost every day his manners are very different from his cousins yes very different but i think mr darcy improves on acquaintance indeed cried wickham with a look which did not escape her,novel
i think you're right. i didn't see him for three weeks. i'm not sure what happened.,chit-chat
and pray may i ask but checking himself he added in a gayer tone is it in address that he improves,novel
i'm not sure. i don't know if he's getting better or not.,chit-chat
has he deigned to add aught of civility to his ordinary style,novel
i don't think so. i'm not sure what he's going to do about it.,chit-chat
for i dare not hope he continued in a lower and more serious tone that he is improved in essentials oh no said elizabeth,novel
i don't blame you. i'm sure he's going to be great.,chit-chat
in essentials i believe he is very much what he ever was while she spoke wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm not sure if i agree with that.,chit-chat
there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention while she added when i said that he improved on acquaintance i did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement but that from knowing him better his disposition was better understood wickhams alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look for a few minutes he was silent till shaking off his embarrassment he turned to her again and said in the gentlest of accents you who so well know my feelings towards mr darcy will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the _appearance_ of what is right,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. i'm not sure i'd be able to deal with someone like that.",chit-chat
his pride in that direction may be of service if not to himself to many others for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
i only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you i imagine have been alluding is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm not sure i could do that.,chit-chat
his fear of her has always operated i know when they were together and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh which i am certain he has very much at heart elizabeth could not repress a smile at this but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head,novel
i'm not familiar with miss de bourgh. what does she do for a living?,chit-chat
she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances and she was in no humour to indulge him,novel
that's terrible. i'm sorry you had to go through that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
the rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_ on his side of usual cheerfulness but with no further attempt to distinguish elizabeth and they parted at last with mutual civility and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
when the party broke up lydia returned with mrs forster to meryton from whence they were to set out early the next morning,novel
"oh my god, that's terrible. i'm sorry you had to go through that.",chit-chat
the separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did she do to make you feel that way?,chit-chat
kitty was the only one who shed tears but she did weep from vexation and envy,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
mrs bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possibleadvice which there was every reason to believe would be attended to and in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard,novel
"hello, mrs. bennet, how are you? i hope you are having a good day.",chit-chat

i've never heard of xlii. what's it about? do you like it?,chit-chat
illustration had elizabeths opinion been all drawn from her own family she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i've never heard of elizabeths before.",chit-chat
her father captivated by youth and beauty and that appearance of goodhumour which youth and beauty generally give had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. it must have been hard for her. i hope she's doing better now.,chit-chat
respect esteem and confidence had vanished for ever and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find happiness in your life.,chit-chat
but mr bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice,novel
"that's a good point. i've never thought about it that way before, but it makes sense.",chit-chat
he was fond of the country and of books and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments,novel
that's great! i'm glad to hear that he enjoyed it. what kind of books did he like?,chit-chat
to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
this is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife but where other powers of entertainment are wanting the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you saying that you don't want to owe your wife?,chit-chat
elizabeth however had never been blind to the impropriety of her fathers behaviour as a husband,novel
i didn't know that. do you have a source for that? i'm curious.,chit-chat
she had always seen it with pain but respecting his abilities and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children was so highly reprehensible,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope she's doing better now. what happened to her?,chit-chat
but she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so illjudged a direction of talentstalents which rightly used might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife,novel
that's a very good point. i'm not sure if i agree with that.,chit-chat
when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickhams departure she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. it must have been very hard for her to lose.,chit-chat
their parties abroad were less varied than before and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of everything around them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle and though kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense since the disturbers of her brain were removed her other sister from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a wateringplace and a camp,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i've never heard of a wateringplace before.",chit-chat
upon the whole therefore she found what has been sometimes found before that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire did not in taking place bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad she found what she was looking for.,chit-chat
it was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation console herself for the present and prepare for another disappointment,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get it fixed.,chit-chat
her tour to the lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother and kitty made inevitable and could she have included jane in the scheme every part of it would have been perfect,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope she's doing better now. did you have a good time?,chit-chat
but it is fortunate thought she that i have something to wish for,novel
that's nice of you. i'm sure you'll get it one day.,chit-chat
were the whole arrangement complete my disappointment would be certain,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you end up doing to make up for it?,chit-chat
but here by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sisters absence i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you have a good time with your sisters.,chit-chat
a scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation when lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and kitty but her letters were always long expected and always very short,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find peace in your life.,chit-chat
those to her mother contained little else than that they were just returned from the library where such and such officers had attended them and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild that she had a new gown or a new parasol which she would have described more fully but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry as mrs forster called her and they were going to the camp and from her correspondence with her sister there was still less to be learnt for her letters to kitty though rather longer were much too full of lines under the words to be made public,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope kitty feels better now that she's gone.,chit-chat
after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence health goodhumour and cheerfulness began to reappear at longbourn,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. do you think she's going to come back?,chit-chat
everything wore a happier aspect,novel
that's good to hear. it's always good to have a positive outlook on things.,chit-chat

thank you so much! i'm so proud of her. she's a great artist.,chit-chat
but lizzy you can tell us whether it is like or not mrs reynolds respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master,novel
i don't think it is like that. i think it's more like she's not very good at her job.,chit-chat
does that young lady know mr darcy elizabeth coloured and said a little and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman maam yes very handsome i am sure _i_ know none so handsome but in the gallery upstairs you will see a finer larger picture of him than this,novel

this room was my late masters favourite room and these miniatures are just as they used to be then,novel

mrs reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy drawn when she was only eight years old,novel
"wow, that must have been a fun drawing. did you get to see her in person?",chit-chat
and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother said mr gardiner,novel

"wow, that sounds like a lot of fun. what are you going to do with it?",chit-chat
is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year not so much as i could wish sir but i dare say he may spend half his time here and miss darcy is always down for the summer months except thought elizabeth when she goes to ramsgate if your master would marry you might see more of him yes sir but i do not know when _that_ will be,novel
"i don't know when my master will be, but i'm sure he'll come around.",chit-chat
i do not know who is good enough for him mr and mrs gardiner smiled,novel
"i don't know either, but i'm sure they're both very good.",chit-chat
elizabeth could not help saying it is very much to his credit i am sure that you should think so i say no more than the truth and what everybody will say that knows him replied the other,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure i'd trust her to be honest.,chit-chat
elizabeth thought this was going pretty far and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added i have never had a cross word from him in my life and i have known him ever since he was four years old this was praise of all others most extraordinary most opposite to her ideas,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find a better housekeeper.,chit-chat
that he was not a goodtempered man had been her firmest opinion,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
her keenest attention was awakened she longed to hear more and was grateful to her uncle for saying there are very few people of whom so much can be said,novel

you are lucky in having such a master yes sir i know i am,novel
thank you! i'm very lucky to have such a good relationship with him. he's my best friend.,chit-chat
if i were to go through the world i could not meet with a better,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what made you want to go through the world so much?,chit-chat
but i have always observed that they who are goodnatured when children are goodnatured when they grow up and he was always the sweetest tempered most generoushearted boy in the world elizabeth almost stared at her,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of that before. what does goodnatured mean?,chit-chat
can this be mr darcy thought she,novel
i don't think so. i'm not sure what mr. darcy thinks about that.,chit-chat
his father was an excellent man said mrs gardiner,novel

i don't know who that is. i'm not sure who that's.,chit-chat
she related the subjects of the pictures the dimensions of the rooms and the price of the furniture in vain,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to talk to her about it.,chit-chat
mr gardiner highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master soon led again to the subject and she dwelt with energy on his many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase,novel
i've never heard of that type of family prejudice before. what does it entail?,chit-chat
he is the best landlord and the best master said she that ever lived,novel
that's great to hear. i'm glad he's doing well for himself.,chit-chat

there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name,novel
that's a good idea. i'm not sure what i want to name him.,chit-chat
some people call him proud but i am sure i never saw anything of it,novel
that's good to hear. i'm sure he's proud of you for doing something you love.,chit-chat
to my fancy it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men in what an amiable light does this place him thought elizabeth,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
this fine account of him whispered her aunt as they walked is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend perhaps we might be deceived that is not very likely our authority was too good on reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty sittingroom lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below and were informed that it was but just done to give pleasure to miss darcy who had taken a liking to the room when last at pemberley,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to talk to your friend about it.,chit-chat

"that's true, but i'm not sure if he's going to do it.",chit-chat
there is nothing he would not do for her the picture gallery and two or three of the principal bedrooms were all that remained to be shown,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to work through it.,chit-chat
in the former were many good paintings but elizabeth knew nothing of the art and from such as had been already visible below she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss darcys in crayons whose subjects were usually more interesting and also more intelligible,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of miss darcys before. what's her name?,chit-chat
in the gallery there were many family portraits but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure i could do that. what did you do?,chit-chat
elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her,novel
"hello elizabeth, how are you? i just got back from a walk in with my best friend.",chit-chat
at last it arrested herand she beheld a striking resemblance of mr darcy with such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at her,novel
that's so cool! i've never heard of mr darcy before. what's his name?,chit-chat
she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery,novel
"wow, that's a long time to wait. i'm sorry to hear that.",chit-chat
mrs reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his fathers lifetime,novel
"that's really sweet of her. i've never seen the movie, but i hear it's pretty good.",chit-chat
there was certainly at this moment in elizabeths mind a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad you're okay.,chit-chat
the commendation bestowed on him by mrs reynolds was of no trifling nature,novel
"i haven't read that one yet, but i've heard good things about it.",chit-chat

how much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow,novel
"i don't know about you, but i've never had pleasure or pain in my life.",chit-chat
how much of good or evil must be done by him,novel
i don't know. i'm not sure if he's evil or not.,chit-chat
every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character and as she stood before the canvas on which he was represented and fixed his eyes upon herself she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before she remembered its warmth and softened its impropriety of expression,novel
that was very nice of you to say. i'm glad you enjoyed it. what do you do for fun?,chit-chat
when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen they returned down stairs and taking leave of the housekeeper were consigned over to the gardener who met them at the hall door,novel
that's really nice of them. i'm glad they were able to get out of the house.,chit-chat
as they walked across the lawn towards the river elizabeth turned back to look again her uncle and aunt stopped also and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables,novel
"wow, that must have been a long time ago. did you find out who did it?",chit-chat
they were within twenty yards of each other and so abrupt was his appearance that it was impossible to avoid his sight,novel

he absolutely started and for a moment seemed immovable from surprise but shortly recovering himself advanced towards the party and spoke to elizabeth if not in terms of perfect composure at least of perfect civility,novel
i'm glad to hear that. it's good that he's doing so well.,chit-chat
she had instinctively turned away but stopping on his approach received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
had his first appearance or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw mr darcy the gardeners expression of surprise on beholding his master must immediately have told it,novel
"wow, that's interesting. did you find out who he was or what he looked like?",chit-chat
they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece who astonished and confused scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face and knew not what answer she returned to his civil inquiries after her family,novel
"wow, that's crazy. i'm glad they were able to get it over with.",chit-chat
amazed at the alteration of his manner since they last parted every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind the few minutes in which they continued together were some of the most uncomfortable of her life,novel
i can't imagine how uncomfortable that must have been for her. i don't think i'd be able to do that.,chit-chat
nor did he seem much more at ease when he spoke his accent had none of its usual sedateness and he repeated his inquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn and of her stay in derbyshire so often and in so hurried a way as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a fan of plainly.",chit-chat
at length every idea seemed to fail him and after standing a few moments without saying a word he suddenly recollected himself and took leave,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
the others then joined her and expressed their admiration of his figure but elizabeth heard not a word and wholly engrossed by her own feelings followed them in silence,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. i'm not familiar with the others. what's their name?",chit-chat
she was overpowered by shame and vexation,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
her coming there was the most unfortunate the most illjudged thing in the world,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what was the most unfortunate thing that happened to you?,chit-chat
how strange must it appear to him,novel
i don't know. i'm not sure what he's up to these days.,chit-chat
in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. what's so bad about it?,chit-chat
it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again,novel
i don't think so. i think she's just trying to make me feel better.,chit-chat
oh,novel
do you have any pets? i have a dog and a cat. they are so cute.,chit-chat
why did she come,novel
i don't know. i'm not sure. i guess i'll have to find out.,chit-chat
or why did he thus come a day before he was expected,novel
that's a good question. i don't know. i'm not sure.,chit-chat
had they been only ten minutes sooner they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination for it was plain that he was that moment arrived that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure why they didn't do anything about it.,chit-chat
she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad you were able to work it out.,chit-chat
and his behaviour so strikingly alteredwhat could it mean,novel
i don't know... i'm not sure what to say to him.,chit-chat
that he should even speak to her was amazingbut to speak with such civility to inquire after her family,novel
i agree. i think it's a good idea to speak to her after her family.,chit-chat
never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she's able to get over it.,chit-chat
what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosings park when he put his letter into her hand,novel
i didn't even know rosings park was a thing. i'll have to check it out.,chit-chat
she knew not what to think or how to account for it,novel
that's a good way to look at it. it's hard to know what to do when you don't know what you're doing.,chit-chat
they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it and though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out she distinguished no part of the scene,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i've never been in a situation like that before.",chit-chat
her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house whichever it might be where mr darcy then was,novel
i've never heard of mr darcy. what's his name? i'm not familiar with him.,chit-chat
she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind in what manner he thought of her and whether in defiance of everything she was still dear to him,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm not sure i could do that.,chit-chat
perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease yet there had been _that_ in his voice which was not like ease,novel
that's a good way of looking at it. it's hard to tell sometimes.,chit-chat
whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not tell but he certainly had not seen her with composure,novel
that's a good point. i wonder if composure was in a relationship with someone else.,chit-chat
at length however the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself,novel
that's interesting. what did she say about her companions on her absence of mind roused her?,chit-chat
they entered the woods and bidding adieu to the river for a while ascended some of the higher grounds whence in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander were many charming views of the valley the opposite hills with the long range of woods overspreading many and occasionally part of the stream,novel
"wow, that sounds like a lot of fun. did you have a good time at all?",chit-chat
mr gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park but feared it might be beyond a walk,novel
i've never heard of mr. gardiner. what's he up to these days?,chit-chat
with a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round,novel
"wow, that's a long way from where i live. how long did it take you to get there?",chit-chat
it settled the matter and they pursued the accustomed circuit which brought them again after some time in a descent among hanging woods to the edge of the water and one of its narrowest parts,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. i've never heard of a narrowest part before.",chit-chat
they crossed it by a simple bridge in character with the general air of the scene it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited and the valley here contracted into a glen allowed room only for the stream and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppicewood which bordered it,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. i'm glad you have a safe place to go.,chit-chat
elizabeth longed to explore its windings but when they had crossed the bridge and perceived their distance from the house mrs gardiner who was not a great walker could go no farther and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible,novel
i've never read any of elizabeth's books. what's your favorite one?,chit-chat
her niece was therefore obliged to submit and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river in the nearest direction but their progress was slow for mr gardiner though seldom able to indulge the taste was very fond of fishing and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water and talking to the man about them that he advanced but little,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. how long have you been fishing? did you catch any?,chit-chat
whilst wandering on in this slow manner they were again surprised and elizabeths astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first by the sight of mr darcy approaching them and at no great distance,novel
i'm so happy for you! i hope you're doing well. what did you do?,chit-chat
the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side allowed them to see him before they met,novel
that's very nice of them. i'm glad they were able to see each other.,chit-chat
elizabeth however astonished was at least more prepared for an interview than before and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness if he really intended to meet them,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a big fan of elizabeth.",chit-chat
for a few moments indeed she felt that he would probably strike into some other path,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he didn't.,chit-chat
the idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view the turning past he was immediately before them,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never done that before. what did you do?,chit-chat
with a glance she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility and to imitate his politeness she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place but she had not got beyond the words delightful and charming when some unlucky recollections obtruded and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her might be mischievously construed,novel
i love pemberley! he's such a great man. i'm sure you've heard of him before.,chit-chat
her colour changed and she said no more,novel
i am sorry to hear that. did she say why she did not want to do it?,chit-chat
mrs gardiner was standing a little behind and on her pausing he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends,novel
that's a good way to introduce him to her friends. i'm sure she would like that.,chit-chat
this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself,novel
that's great. i'm glad you were able to get to know her better.,chit-chat
what will be his surprise thought she when he knows who they are,novel
i don't know yet. i'm not sure what she's going to think.,chit-chat
he takes them now for people of fashion the introduction however was immediately made and as she named their relationship to herself she stole a sly look at him to see how he bore it and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions,novel
"oh my god, that's terrible. i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope he doesn't do that again.",chit-chat
that he was _surprised_ by the connection was evident he sustained it however with fortitude and so far from going away turned back with them and entered into conversation with mr gardiner,novel
that's really interesting. did you find out who he was or what he was up to?,chit-chat
elizabeth could not but be pleased could not but triumph,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did she do that made you so upset about it?,chit-chat
it was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i don't think i could do that.,chit-chat
she listened most attentively to all that passed between them and gloried in every expression every sentence of her uncle which marked his intelligence his taste or his good manners,novel
that's really sweet of her. i'm sure she's a great aunt.,chit-chat
the conversation soon turned upon fishing and she heard mr darcy invite him with the greatest civility to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport,novel
that's really nice of mr darcy to invite him there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle and pointed out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport,chit-chat
mrs gardiner who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth gave her a look expressive of her wonder,novel
"hey, how are you doing today? i just got back from a walk in the park.",chit-chat
elizabeth said nothing but it gratified her exceedingly the compliment must be all for herself,novel
what did she say? i'm not familiar with elizabeth. what was the compliment about?,chit-chat
her astonishment however was extreme and continually was she repeating why is he so altered,novel
i don't think i've ever seen someone like that before. what did she do?,chit-chat
from what can it proceed,novel
i'm not sure. it's been a while since i've seen it.,chit-chat
it can not be for _me_ it can not be for _my_ sake that his manners are thus softened,novel
that's what i'm thinking. i don't know what to do about it.,chit-chat
my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you have to do to make it work?,chit-chat
it is impossible that he should still love me after walking some time in this way the two ladies in front the two gentlemen behind on resuming their places after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious waterplant there chanced to be a little alteration,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
it originated in mrs gardiner who fatigued by the exercise of the morning found elizabeths arm inadequate to her support and consequently preferred her husbands,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i didn't know that. do you have a source for that information?",chit-chat
mr darcy took her place by her niece and they walked on together,novel
that's really sweet of mr. darcy to take her place by her niece and walk with them together.,chit-chat
after a short silence the lady first spoke,novel
that's pretty cool. did you get to talk to her? did you have a good time?,chit-chat
she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place and accordingly began by observing that his arrival had been very unexpectedfor your housekeeper she added informed us that you would certainly not be here till tomorrow and indeed before we left bakewell we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country he acknowledged the truth of it all and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling,novel
"wow, that's a long story. i'm sorry to hear that. how long did it take for him to get back?",chit-chat
they will join me early tomorrow he continued and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with youmr bingley and his sisters elizabeth answered only by a slight bow,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm sure you'll have a lot of fun.,chit-chat
her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when mr bingleys name had been last mentioned between them and if she might judge from his complexion _his_ mind was not very differently engaged,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of mr bingleys name before. what's his name?,chit-chat
there is also one other person in the party he continued after a pause who more particularly wishes to be known to you,novel
that's not good. i'm sorry you had to go through that. what did you do?,chit-chat
will you allow me or do i ask too much to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton the surprise of such an application was great indeed it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it,novel
i'm sure you'll be fine. what is lambton like? i've never been.,chit-chat
she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother and without looking farther it was satisfactory it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm sure miss darcy feels the same way.,chit-chat
they now walked on in silence each of them deep in thought,novel
that's awesome! i'm so happy for you. i hope you have a great day!,chit-chat
elizabeth was not comfortable that was impossible but she was flattered and pleased,novel
that's good to hear. i'm glad you were able to make it work.,chit-chat
his wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind,novel
that's really sweet of him. i wish i had a sister to introduce me to.,chit-chat
they soon outstripped the others and when they had reached the carriage mr and mrs gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind,novel
"wow, that's a long way from home. i'm sorry to hear that.",chit-chat
he then asked her to walk into the housebut she declared herself not tired and they stood together on the lawn,novel
that's really sweet of him. i'm glad he didn't do that to her.,chit-chat
at such a time much might have been said and silence was very awkward,novel
that's what i was thinking. i'm not sure what to do with myself.,chit-chat
she wanted to talk but there seemed an embargo on every subject,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what subject did she want to talk to you about?,chit-chat
at last she recollected that she had been travelling and they talked of matlock and dovedale with great perseverance,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. what happened to matlock and dovedale?",chit-chat
yet time and her aunt moved slowlyand her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the _têteàtête_ was over,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she's able to get back on her feet soon.,chit-chat
on mr and mrs gardiners coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment but this was declined and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness,novel
that's really nice of them. i'm glad they were able to get through it.,chit-chat
mr darcy handed the ladies into the carriage and when it drove off elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house,novel
that was nice of mr darcy to take the ladies into the carriage. did you have a good time?,chit-chat
the observations of her uncle and aunt now began and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected,novel
that's so sweet of them. i'm sure they're proud of him.,chit-chat
he is perfectly wellbehaved polite and unassuming said her uncle,novel
that's good to hear. i don't think i'd be able to do that.,chit-chat
there _is_ something a little stately in him to be sure replied her aunt but it is confined to his air and is not unbecoming,novel
i don't think so. i'm not sure what he's up to.,chit-chat
i can now say with the housekeeper that though some people may call him proud _i_ have seen nothing of it i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us,novel
that's good to hear. i'm glad he's doing well for himself.,chit-chat
it was more than civil it was really attentive and there was no necessity for such attention,novel
that's true. i'm glad it worked out for you. i hope you're doing well.,chit-chat
his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling to be sure lizzy said her aunt he is not so handsome as wickham or rather he has not wickhams countenance for his features are perfectly good,novel
i didn't know that lizzy said that. what did lizzy say about her aunt?,chit-chat
but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable elizabeth excused herself as well as she could said that she had liked him better when they met in kent than before and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning,novel
i didn't mean to tell you that. i'm not sure what you mean by that.,chit-chat
but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities replied her uncle,novel
i don't think so. i think he just doesn't know what he's doing.,chit-chat
your great men often are and therefore i shall not take him at his word about fishing as he might change his mind another day and warn me off his grounds elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character but said nothing,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do to make him change his mind?,chit-chat
from what we have seen of him continued mrs gardiner i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor wickham,novel
i didn't realize he did that. i thought he was just trying to make a living.,chit-chat
he has not an illnatured look,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you saying that he doesn't look good?,chit-chat
on the contrary there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks,novel
oh yeah? what is it about him that you find pleasing about his mouth? i don't know much about him.,chit-chat
and there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a big fan of trump.",chit-chat
but to be sure the good lady who showed us the house did give him a most flaming character,novel
i don't think so. i'm sure he's a nice guy though.,chit-chat
i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what made you laugh so much? i've never laughed so hard in my life.,chit-chat
but he is a liberal master i suppose and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham and therefore gave them to understand in as guarded a manner as she could that by what she had heard from his relations in kent his actions were capable of a very different construction and that his character was by no means so faulty nor wickhams so amiable as they had been considered in hertfordshire,novel
i don't know why you're being downvoted. i agree with you completely.,chit-chat
in confirmation of this she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected without actually naming her authority but stating it to be such as might be relied on,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of that before. what is it about?,chit-chat
mrs gardiner was surprised and concerned but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures every idea gave way to the charm of recollection and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of anything else,novel
"hello, how are you doing today? i hope you are having a good day, mr. gardiner.",chit-chat
fatigued as she had been by the mornings walk they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance,novel
"wow, that's a long time. how long did it take for her to come back?",chit-chat
the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends and she could do nothing but think and think with wonder of mr darcys civility and above all of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister,novel
"hello, how are you doing today? i'm elizabeth and i've been here all day.",chit-chat
illustration chapter xliv,novel
do you like to read? i've been reading a lot lately and i'm really enjoying it.,chit-chat
illustration elizabeth had settled it that mr darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching pemberley and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you were able to get out of the inn.,chit-chat
but her conclusion was false for on the very morning after their own arrival at lambton these visitors came,novel
that's a shame. i'm sorry to hear that. how long did it take them to get to lambton?,chit-chat
they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle driving up the street,novel
that's really nice of them to do that. i'm glad they didn't get hurt.,chit-chat
elizabeth immediately recognizing the livery guessed what it meant and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she expected,novel
"hello, elizabeth. how are you doing today? i hope you are having a good day.",chit-chat
her uncle and aunt were all amazement and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke joined to the circumstance itself and many of the circumstances of the preceding day opened to them a new idea on the business,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope they were able to get it resolved quickly.,chit-chat
nothing had ever suggested it before but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to work it out.,chit-chat
while these newlyborn notions were passing in their heads the perturbation of elizabeths feelings was every moment increasing,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're feeling better now. do you feel better now?,chit-chat
she was quite amazed at her own discomposure but amongst other causes of disquiet she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour and more than commonly anxious to please she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she's able to get over it.,chit-chat
she retreated from the window fearful of being seen and as she walked up and down the room endeavouring to compose herself saw such looks of inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay. are you okay?,chit-chat
miss darcy and her brother appeared and this formidable introduction took place,novel
that's really cool. did you get to see miss darcy's brother in person?,chit-chat
with astonishment did elizabeth see that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself,novel
i don't think so. i'm not sure if she was embarrassed or not.,chit-chat
since her being at lambton she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she's able to get over it.,chit-chat
she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to work through it.,chit-chat
miss darcy was tall and on a larger scale than elizabeth and though little more than sixteen her figure was formed and her appearance womanly and graceful,novel
"i've never heard of miss darcy, but i'll look her up. what's her name?",chit-chat
she was less handsome than her brother but there was sense and goodhumour in her face and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle,novel
that's very nice of her. i'm sure she's a great person.,chit-chat
elizabeth who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr darcy had been was much relieved by discerning such different feelings,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you were able to get through it.,chit-chat
they had not been long together before darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her and she had barely time to express her satisfaction and prepare for such a visitor when bingleys quick step was heard on the stairs and in a moment he entered the room,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. it must have been so hard for her. i hope she's okay.,chit-chat
all elizabeths anger against him had been long done away but had she still felt any it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get through it.,chit-chat
he inquired in a friendly though general way after her family and looked and spoke with the same goodhumoured ease that he had ever done,novel
that's really nice of him. i'm sure he's a great person.,chit-chat
to mr and mrs gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i've never met mr. gardiner. what happened to him?,chit-chat
they had long wished to see him,novel
why did they wish to see him? what did you do to make him want to see you?,chit-chat
the whole party before them indeed excited a lively attention,novel
that's what i was thinking. it's always nice to have a good time.,chit-chat
the suspicions which had just arisen of mr darcy and their niece directed their observation towards each with an earnest though guarded inquiry and they soon drew from those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. i've never heard of mr darcy before. what's his name?",chit-chat
of the ladys sensations they remained a little in doubt but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough,novel
that's a good way to look at it. it's always good to admire someone.,chit-chat
elizabeth on her side had much to do,novel
elizabeth on her side had much to do with the fact that she died in a car crash.,chit-chat
she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors she wanted to compose her own and to make herself agreeable to all and in the latter object where she feared most to fail she was most sure of success for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour,novel
that's a very interesting way to look at it. do you have a favorite color?,chit-chat
bingley was ready georgiana was eager and darcy determined to be pleased,novel
what did bingley do for a living? i've never heard of him before.,chit-chat
illustration to make herself agreeable to all _copyright 1894 by george allen_ in seeing bingley her thoughts naturally flew to her sister and oh,novel
"i've never heard of george allen_, but i'm familiar with him. are you a fan of his work?",chit-chat
how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner,novel
"i'm not sure, but i don't think it was directed in a like manner.",chit-chat
sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her he was trying to trace a resemblance,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i don't think i could do that.,chit-chat
but though this might be imaginary she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy who had been set up as a rival to jane,novel
"i don't think so. i'm not a fan of jane either, but i can't help but feel bad for her.",chit-chat
no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to work through it.,chit-chat
nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister,novel
that's what i was thinking. i don't know what to do with myself.,chit-chat
on this point she was soon satisfied and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted which in her anxious interpretation denoted a recollection of jane not untinctured by tenderness and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her had he dared,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad you're okay.,chit-chat
he observed to her at a moment when the others were talking together and in a tone which had something of real regret that it was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her and before she could reply he added it is above eight months,novel
"wow, that's a long time. i'm sorry to hear that. how long did it take him to respond?",chit-chat
we have not met since the 26th of november when we were all dancing together at netherfield elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact and he afterwards took occasion to ask her when unattended to by any of the rest whether _all_ her sisters were at longbourn,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. it must have been very hard for you to meet up with her.,chit-chat
there was not much in the question nor in the preceding remark but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning,novel
that's a good way to look at it. what did you look for in the question?,chit-chat
it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr darcy himself but whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general complaisance and in all that he said she heard an accent so far removed from _hauteur_ or disdain of his companions as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence might prove had at least outlived one day,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of mr darcy before. what does he sound like?,chit-chat
when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace when she saw him thus civil not only to herself but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage the difference the change was so great and struck so forcibly on her mind that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible,novel
that's really interesting. i've never heard of hunsford parsonage before.,chit-chat
never even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield or his dignified relations at rosings had she seen him so desirous to please so free from selfconsequence or unbending reserve as now when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're doing well in your life.,chit-chat
their visitors stayed with them above half an hour and when they arose to depart mr darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing mr and mrs gardiner and miss bennet to dinner at pemberley before they left the country,novel
"wow, that's a long time to stay with them. did they have a good time?",chit-chat
miss darcy though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations readily obeyed,novel
i'm not familiar with miss darcy. what does she do that marked her little in the habit of giving invitations readily obeyed?,chit-chat
mrs gardiner looked at her niece desirous of knowing how _she_ whom the invitation most concerned felt disposed as to its acceptance but elizabeth had turned away her head,novel
"i'm so sorry to hear that, elizabeth. i hope you're doing well.",chit-chat
presuming however that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal and seeing in her husband who was fond of society a perfect willingness to accept it she ventured to engage for her attendance and the day after the next was fixed on,novel
i don't think i'd be able to do that. i'm not sure i could do it.,chit-chat
bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again having still a great deal to say to her and many inquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends,novel
i'm glad to hear that. i hope you're having a great time with her.,chit-chat
elizabeth construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister was pleased and on this account as well as some others found herself when their visitors left them capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been little,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you had a good time with your family.,chit-chat
eager to be alone and fearful of inquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt she stayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley and then hurried away to dress,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
but she had no reason to fear mr and mrs gardiners curiosity it was not their wish to force her communication,novel
i don't think she was afraid of them. she was just afraid of the unknown.,chit-chat
it was evident that she was much better acquainted with mr darcy than they had before any idea of it was evident that he was very much in love with her,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i didn't think about it that way.,chit-chat
they saw much to interest but nothing to justify inquiry,novel
that's what i'm thinking. i don't know what to do with myself.,chit-chat
of mr darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well and as far as their acquaintance reached there was no fault to find,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
they could not be untouched by his politeness and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servants report without any reference to any other account the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognized it for mr darcy,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i've never heard of mr darcy before. what's his name?",chit-chat
there was now an interest however in believing the housekeeper and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old and whose own manners indicated respectability was not to be hastily rejected,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of a housekeeper before. what do you do for a living?,chit-chat
neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of their lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight,novel
"i'm sorry to hear that. what happened to your lambton friends, if you don't mind me asking?",chit-chat
they had nothing to accuse him of but pride pride he probably had and if not it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town where the family did not visit,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure what to make of it though.,chit-chat
it was acknowledged however that he was a liberal man and did much good among the poor,novel
that's good to hear. i don't think i could ever be a liberal.,chit-chat
with respect to wickham the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood it was yet a wellknown fact that on his quitting derbyshire he had left many debts behind him which mr darcy afterwards discharged,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope he's able to get back on his feet.,chit-chat
as for elizabeth her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last and the evening though as it passed it seemed long was not long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you were able to get out of the mansion.,chit-chat
she certainly did not hate him,novel
"i don't think she did either, but i'm glad she didn't.",chit-chat
no hatred had vanished long ago and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him that could be so called,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she's able to get over it.,chit-chat
the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities though at first unwillingly admitted had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his favour and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light which yesterday had produced,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad to hear that.,chit-chat
but above all above respect and esteem there was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked,novel
i don't know about that. i'm not sure what motivated her to do that.,chit-chat
it was gratitudegratitude not merely for having once loved her but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
he who she had been persuaded would avoid her as his greatest enemy seemed on this accidental meeting most eager to preserve the acquaintance and without any indelicate display of regard or any peculiarity of manner where their two selves only were concerned was soliciting the good opinion of her friends and bent on making her known to his sister,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i've never heard of a situation like that before.",chit-chat
such a change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but gratitudefor to love ardent love it must be attributed and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged as by no means unpleasing though it could not be exactly defined,novel
that's a great way to look at it. i'm glad you're happy about it.,chit-chat
she respected she esteemed she was grateful to him she felt a real interest in his welfare and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power which her fancy told her she still possessed of bringing on the renewal of his addresses,novel
that's so sweet of her. i'm sure she's proud of him.,chit-chat
it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and niece that such a striking civility as miss darcys in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberleyfor she had reached it only to a late breakfastought to be imitated though it could not be equalled by some exertion of politeness on their side and consequently that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning,novel
"wow, that must have been a long day for them. how long did it take for them to get to pemberley?",chit-chat
they were therefore to go,novel
"that's what i was thinking, but i'm not sure if i want to go.",chit-chat
elizabeth was pleased though when she asked herself the reason she had very little to say in reply,novel
that was nice of her. i'm sure she was happy to hear that. what did she say?,chit-chat
mr gardiner left them soon after breakfast,novel
i love mr. gardiner! he's such a great american singer and songwriter. do you like his music?,chit-chat
the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon,novel
that's awesome! i've never been to pemberley. what is it about?,chit-chat
illustration engaged by the river chapter xlv,novel
i love the river chapter. it's one of my favorite books. have you read it?,chit-chat
illustration convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingleys dislike of her had originated in jealousy she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her and was curious to know with how much civility on that ladys side the acquaintance would now be renewed,novel
i don't think i've ever heard of miss bingleys before. what does she look like?,chit-chat
on reaching the house they were shown through the hall into the saloon whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer,novel
that must have been really nice. did you get to go to the saloon and have a good time?,chit-chat
its windows opening to the ground admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chestnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. what do you like to do in your free time?,chit-chat
in this room they were received by miss darcy who was sitting there with mrs hurst and miss bingley and the lady with whom she lived in london,novel
"oh wow, that's really interesting. i've never heard of miss darcy before.",chit-chat
georgianas reception of them was very civil but attended with all that embarrassment which though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved,novel
i've never heard of georgianas before. i'll have to look them up.,chit-chat
mrs gardiner and her niece however did her justice and pitied her,novel
i've never heard of mrs gardiner. what's her name? is she still alive?,chit-chat
by mrs hurst and miss bingley they were noticed only by a courtesy and on their being seated a pause awkward as such pauses must always be succeeded for a few moments,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
it was first broken by mrs annesley a genteel agreeablelooking woman whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly wellbred than either of the others and between her and mrs gardiner with occasional help from elizabeth the conversation was carried on,novel
that's really interesting. i've never heard of her before. what did she say?,chit-chat
miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it and sometimes did venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard,novel
i don't think i've ever seen miss darcy before. what's her name?,chit-chat
elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley and that she could not speak a word especially to miss darcy without calling her attention,novel
i love miss bingley. she's such a great singer and songwriter. i love her music.,chit-chat
this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much her own thoughts were employing her,novel
i don't think she was sorry at all. she was just trying to make herself feel better about herself.,chit-chat
she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room she wished she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them and whether she wished or feared it most she could scarcely determine,novel
"wow, that must have been a very exciting moment for her. did you have a good time?",chit-chat
after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing miss bingleys voice elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold inquiry after the health of her family,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope she's doing better now. what happened to her family?,chit-chat
she answered with equal indifference and brevity and the other said no more,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i've had that happen to me a few times.,chit-chat
the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat cake and a variety of all the finest fruits in season but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mrs annesley to miss darcy had been given to remind her of her post,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. what did mrs. annesley do to remind you of her post?",chit-chat
there was now employment for the whole party for though they could not all talk they could all eat and the beautiful pyramids of grapes nectarines and peaches soon collected them round the table,novel
"wow, that must have been a lot of fun. did you have a good time with the party?",chit-chat
while thus engaged elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr darcy by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room and then though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate she began to regret that he came,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you were able to get through it.,chit-chat
he had been some time with mr gardiner who with two or three other gentlemen from the house was engaged by the river and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning,novel
that's so sad. i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's doing better now.,chit-chat
no sooner did he appear than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrasseda resolution the more necessary to be made but perhaps not the more easily kept because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room,novel
"that's a good point. i didn't think of it that way, but you're right.",chit-chat
in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingleys in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects for jealousy had not yet made her desperate and her attentions to mr darcy were by no means over,novel
i've never heard of miss bingleys. what does she do for fun?,chit-chat
miss darcy on her brothers entrance exerted herself much more to talk and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted and forwarded as much as possible every attempt at conversation on either side,novel
"i've never heard of miss darcy before, but i'm familiar with elizabeth. what's her name?",chit-chat
miss bingley saw all this likewise and in the imprudence of anger took the first opportunity of saying with sneering civility pray miss eliza are not the shire militia removed from meryton,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're doing better than that.,chit-chat
they must be a great loss to _your_ family in darcys presence she dared not mention wickhams name but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moments distress but exerting herself vigorously to repel the illnatured attack she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. it must have been very hard for her to lose her family.,chit-chat
while she spoke an involuntary glance showed her darcy with a heightened complexion earnestly looking at her and his sister overcome with confusion and unable to lift up her eyes,novel
that must have been very difficult for her. i hope she was able to get over it.,chit-chat
had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcys opinion and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps,novel
that's really interesting. i've never heard of miss bingley before. what's her name?,chit-chat
not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcys meditated elopement,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she's doing better now. what happened to miss darcys?,chit-chat
to no creature had it been revealed where secrecy was possible except to elizabeth and from all bingleys connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it from that very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him of their becoming hereafter her own,novel
that's interesting. i didn't know that. do you have a favorite character?,chit-chat
he had certainly formed such a plan and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend,novel
i don't think so. i think it's more likely that he's just trying to get by.,chit-chat
elizabeths collected behaviour however soon quieted his emotion and as miss bingley vexed and disappointed dared not approach nearer to wickham georgiana also recovered in time though not enough to be able to speak any more,novel
"i'm so sorry to hear that, elizabeths. what happened to him?",chit-chat
her brother whose eye she feared to meet scarcely recollected her interest in the affair and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i've never heard of that before. what happened?",chit-chat
their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned and while mr darcy was attending them to their carriage miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeths person behaviour and dress,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. it must have been very hard for mr darcy.,chit-chat
but georgiana would not join her,novel
"i don't know what that means, but i'm not sure it means what you think it means.",chit-chat
her brothers recommendation was enough to insure her favour his judgment could not err and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of georgiana before. what's her name?,chit-chat
when darcy returned to the saloon miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister,novel
i've never heard of miss bingley before. what did she say to him?,chit-chat
how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning mr darcy she cried i never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she feels better soon. what happened to her?,chit-chat
she is grown so brown and coarse,novel
that's a good thing. i'm sure she'll grow out of it.,chit-chat
louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again however little mr darcy might have liked such an address he contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tannedno miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
for my own part she rejoined i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did she do to make you feel that way?,chit-chat
her face is too thin her complexion has no brilliancy and her features are not at all handsome,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a fan of ugly people.",chit-chat
her nose wants character there is nothing marked in its lines,novel
"that's what i thought too, but i think it's just an optical effect.",chit-chat
her teeth are tolerable but not out of the common way and as for her eyes which have sometimes been called so fine i never could perceive anything extraordinary in them,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by tolerable. are you referring to her teeth?,chit-chat
they have a sharp shrewish look which i do not like at all and in her air altogether there is a selfsufficiency without fashion which is intolerable persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth this was not the best method of recommending herself but angry people are not always wise and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled she had all the success she expected,novel
i don't think i've ever heard of miss bingley. what's her name?,chit-chat
he was resolutely silent however and from a determination of making him speak she continued i remember when we first knew her in hertfordshire how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty and i particularly recollect your saying one night after they had been dining at netherfield _she_ a beauty,novel
that's amazing! i'm so happy for you. i hope you have a wonderful day!,chit-chat
i should as soon call her mother a wit but afterwards she seemed to improve on you and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time yes replied darcy who could contain himself no longer but _that_ was only when i first knew her for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance he then went away and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
mrs gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit as they returned except what had particularly interested them both,novel
that must have been a very interesting visit. did they have a lot of fun with each other?,chit-chat
the looks and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention,novel
i hate when people do that. it makes me feel like i'm in the wrong place at the wrong time.,chit-chat
they talked of his sister his friends his house his fruit of everything but himself yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs gardiner thought of him and mrs gardiner would have been highly gratified by her nieces beginning the subject,novel
i don't think i've ever seen that episode. what did she say to him?,chit-chat
illustration chapter xlvi,novel
have you ever read xlvi? it's my favorite book of all time. do you like it?,chit-chat
illustration elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane on their first arrival at lambton and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there but on the third her repining was over and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere,novel
oh no! i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you can get it resolved soon.,chit-chat
elizabeth was not surprised at it as jane had written the direction remarkably ill,novel
i didn't know that. what's the name of the book you're referring to?,chit-chat
they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in and her uncle and aunt leaving her to enjoy them in quiet set off by themselves,novel

"wow, that's a long time ago. i'm sorry you had to go through that.",chit-chat
the beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements with such news as the country afforded but the latter half which was dated a day later and written in evident agitation gave more important intelligence,novel

it was to this effect since writing the above dearest lizzy something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature but i am afraid of alarming yoube assured that we are all well,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope everything works out for you and your family.,chit-chat

so imprudent a match on both sides,novel
"i know, i was so happy to see them win. i can't wait to see what happens next.",chit-chat
but i am willing to hope the best and that his character has been misunderstood,novel
that's a good attitude to have. i'm sure he'll be fine.,chit-chat
thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him but this step and let us rejoice over it marks nothing bad at heart,novel
"i agree, it's a step in the right direction. i'm happy for him.",chit-chat

had i known what i ought what i dared to do,novel
what did you dare to do? was it something you didn't want to do at the time?,chit-chat
but i knew noti was afraid of doing too much,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did she do to make you feel that way?,chit-chat
wretched wretched mistake darcy made no answer,novel

elizabeth soon observed and instantly understood it,novel
i don't get it. what did she understand? i'm not familiar with elizabeth.,chit-chat
her power was sinking everything _must_ sink under such a proof of family weakness such an assurance of the deepest disgrace,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get through it.,chit-chat
she could neither wonder nor condemn but the belief of his selfconquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom afforded no palliation of her distress,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i can't imagine how hard it must have been for her.,chit-chat
it was on the contrary exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him as now when all love must be vain,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i can see how that could make her feel that way.,chit-chat
but self though it would intrude could not engross her,novel
that's true. i'm not sure if i'd be able to handle it.,chit-chat
lydiathe humiliation the misery she was bringing on them allsoon swallowed up every private care and covering her face with her handkerchief elizabeth was soon lost to everything else and after a pause of several minutes was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion who in a manner which though it spoke compassion spoke likewise restraint said i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence nor have i anything to plead in excuse of my stay but real though unavailing concern,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay. what happened to lydiathe?,chit-chat
would to heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress,novel

say that urgent business calls us home immediately,novel
i do that all the time. it makes me feel like i'm in control of the situation.,chit-chat
conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i think i'll do that.,chit-chat
i know it can not be long he readily assured her of his secrecy again expressed his sorrow for her distress wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope and leaving his compliments for her relations with only one serious parting look went away,novel
i don't know what to say to that. i'm not sure what to do with myself.,chit-chat
as he quitted the room elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance so full of contradictions and varieties sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're doing better than that.,chit-chat
if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection elizabeths change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure i've ever felt that way before.,chit-chat
but if otherwise if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object and even before two words have been exchanged nothing can be said in her defence except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for wickham and that its ill success might perhaps authorize her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment,novel
"that's a good point. i'm not sure if it's true, but i think it could be.",chit-chat
be that as it may she saw him go with regret and in this early example of what lydias infamy must produce found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i don't know what to do now.,chit-chat
never since reading janes second letter had she entertained a hope of wickhams meaning to marry her,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get married soon.,chit-chat
no one but jane she thought could flatter herself with such an expectation,novel
that's a good one. i've never heard of jane. what's her name?,chit-chat
surprise was the least of all her feelings on this development,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she's able to get over it.,chit-chat
while the contents of the first letter remained on her mind she was all surprise all astonishment that wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money and how lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible,novel
"wow, that's crazy. i've never heard of that before. what happened?",chit-chat
but now it was all too natural,novel
that's what i'm saying... it's all natural now. i can't believe it.,chit-chat
for such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i think you're right about that.,chit-chat
she had never perceived while the regiment was in hertfordshire that lydia had any partiality for him but she was convinced that lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she didn't have to go through that.,chit-chat
sometimes one officer sometimes another had been her favourite as their attentions raised them in her opinion,novel
that's very nice of her. i'm sure she was very proud of you.,chit-chat
her affections had been continually fluctuating but never without an object,novel
that's a good way to look at it. what did she do to make you feel that way?,chit-chat
the mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girloh,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you talking about a boy or a girl?,chit-chat
how acutely did she now feel it,novel
she didn't feel it at all. i think she's just used to it.,chit-chat
she was wild to be at hometo hear to see to be upon the spot to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her in a family so deranged a father absent a mother incapable of exertion and requiring constant attendance and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia her uncles interference seemed of the utmost importance and till he entered the room the misery of her impatience was severe,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get through it.,chit-chat
mr and mrs gardiner had hurried back in alarm supposing by the servants account that their niece was taken suddenly ill but satisfying them instantly on that head she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons reading the two letters aloud and dwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy,novel
i'm so sorry to hear about your niece. i hope she's better now.,chit-chat
though lydia had never been a favourite with them mr and mrs gardiner could not but be deeply affected,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i've never heard of them before. what happened?,chit-chat
not lydia only but all were concerned in it and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror mr gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power,novel
i've never heard of mr gardiner before. what does he do for a living?,chit-chat
elizabeth though expecting no less thanked him with tears of gratitude and all three being actuated by one spirit everything relating to their journey was speedily settled,novel
elizabeth is one of my favorite characters in the game. she's such a great character.,chit-chat
they were to be off as soon as possible,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad they were off.,chit-chat
but what is to be done about pemberley cried mrs gardiner,novel
i don't think pemberley cried. i think she was upset that she didn't get to go to school.,chit-chat
john told us mr darcy was here when you sent for uswas it so yes and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get through it.,chit-chat
_that_ is all settled what is all settled repeated the other as she ran into her room to prepare,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. what are you going to do with the rest of the room?,chit-chat
and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth,novel
i don't think so. i'm not sure what she's going to do.,chit-chat
oh that i knew how it was but wishes were vain or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour,novel
that's a good point. it's been a long time since i've done anything like that.,chit-chat
had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself but she had her share of business as well as her aunt and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends at lambton with false excuses for their sudden departure,novel
i don't think i've ever heard of lambton. what is it?,chit-chat
an hour however saw the whole completed and mr gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn nothing remained to be done but to go and elizabeth after all the misery of the morning found herself in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed seated in the carriage and on the road to longbourn,novel
"wow, that's a long time. i'm sorry you had to go through that.",chit-chat
illustration the first pleasing earnest of their welcome chapter xlvii,novel
are you a fan of xl7? it's one of my favorite anime series.,chit-chat
illustration i have been thinking it over again elizabeth said her uncle as they drove from the town and really upon serious consideration i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter,novel
i don't think it's fair to judge her for what she's done.,chit-chat
it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless and who was actually staying in his colonels family that i am strongly inclined to hope the best,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure i'd want to be in that situation.,chit-chat
could he expect that her friends would not step forward,novel
i don't think so. i'm not sure if he's a good friend or not.,chit-chat
could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment after such an affront to colonel forster,novel
i don't think so. i'm sure he'll find out soon enough.,chit-chat
his temptation is not adequate to the risk do you really think so cried elizabeth brightening up for a moment,novel
"i don't think so, but i'm not sure what to do about it.",chit-chat
upon my word said mrs gardiner i begin to be of your uncles opinion,novel
i've never heard of mrs gardiner. what's her name? i'm not familiar with her.,chit-chat
it is really too great a violation of decency honour and interest for him to be guilty of it,novel
i know. i am so mad at him for doing it. he should have known better.,chit-chat
i can not think so very ill of wickham,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do to make you feel that way?,chit-chat
can you yourself lizzie so wholly give him up as to believe him capable of it not perhaps of neglecting his own interest,novel
that's a good idea. i think i'm going to give him a chance.,chit-chat
but of every other neglect i can believe him capable,novel
"i know, right? i can't even imagine what he must have been up to.",chit-chat
if indeed it should be so,novel
i don't know. i'm not sure if it's a good thing or not.,chit-chat
but i dare not hope it,novel
i don't either. i'm not sure i'll be able to handle it.,chit-chat
why should they not go on to scotland if that had been the case in the first place replied mr gardiner there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland oh but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a presumption,novel
"i don't know, i'm not a fan of hackney at all.",chit-chat
and besides no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road well thensupposing them to be in londonthey may be there though for the purpose of concealment for no more exceptionable purpose,novel
"that's a good theory, but i'm not sure if it's true.",chit-chat
it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side and it might strike them that they could be more economically though less expeditiously married in london than in scotland but why all this secrecy,novel
i don't know... i'm not sure. i guess i'll have to find out.,chit-chat
why any fear of detection,novel
i don't know. it's just something i've always been afraid of.,chit-chat
why must their marriage be private,novel
"i don't know, i'm not sure. i think it's just a weird thing to do.",chit-chat
oh no nothis is not likely,novel
"yeah, i'm not sure if i'll be able to do it this year.",chit-chat
his most particular friend you see by janes account was persuaded of his never intending to marry her,novel
that's terrible. i'm sorry to hear that. how long have you been friends with him?,chit-chat
wickham will never marry a woman without some money,novel
i don't think so. i think he will find a woman who will love him.,chit-chat
he can not afford it,novel
i can't afford it either. i've been working so hard to get it.,chit-chat
and what claims has lydia what attractions has she beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure if i'd want to marry someone like that.,chit-chat
as to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her i am not able to judge for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce,novel
i don't think so. i think she's just trying to make a living.,chit-chat
but as to your other objection i am afraid it will hardly hold good,novel
i don't think it will. i'm going to have to get a new one.,chit-chat
lydia has no brothers to step forward and he might imagine from my fathers behaviour from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family that _he_ would do as little and think as little about it as any father could do in such a matter but can you think that lydia is so lost to everything but love of him as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage it does seem and it is most shocking indeed replied elizabeth with tears in her eyes that a sisters sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt,novel
"i'm sorry to hear that. i don't think he's lost to everything, but i can understand why he would feel that way.",chit-chat
but really i know not what to say,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what do you want to tell me about your experience?,chit-chat
perhaps i am not doing her justice,novel
i don't think so. i'm sure you're doing her a favor.,chit-chat
but she is very young she has never been taught to think on serious subjects and for the last half year nay for a twelvemonth she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she's able to get through it.,chit-chat
she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner and to adopt any opinions that came in her way,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad she's able to do that.,chit-chat
since the shire were first quartered in meryton nothing but love flirtation and officers have been in her head,novel
"i've never been to meryton, but i'd love to go one day.",chit-chat
she has been doing everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject to give greaterwhat shall i call itsusceptibility to her feelings which are naturally lively enough,novel
that's good to hear. i'm glad she's doing well for herself.,chit-chat
and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman but you see that jane said her aunt does not think so ill of wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt of whom does jane ever think ill,novel
"that's a good point, i didn't think of it that way. it's hard to believe he's capable of such things.",chit-chat
and who is there whatever might be their former conduct that she would believe capable of such an attempt till it were proved against them,novel
that's a good question. i don't know. i'm not sure.,chit-chat
but jane knows as well as i do what wickham really is,novel
what wickham really is? i've never heard of it. what's it about?,chit-chat
we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word that he has neither integrity nor honour that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating and do you really know all this cried mrs gardiner whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive,novel
"i don't know much about mrs gardiner, but i do know that he is a liar.",chit-chat
i do indeed replied elizabeth colouring,novel
i've never heard of that. what's it like? do you like it?,chit-chat
i told you the other day of his infamous behaviour to mr darcy and you yourself when last at longbourn heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him,novel
"i've never heard of mr darcy, but i'm not familiar with him. what did he do?",chit-chat
and there are other circumstances which i am not at libertywhich it is not worth while to relate but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get through it.,chit-chat
from what he said of miss darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud reserved disagreeable girl,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
yet he knew to the contrary himself,novel
that's what i was thinking. it's like he didn't even try.,chit-chat
he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her but does lydia know nothing of this,novel
i don't think so. i think it's more likely that he doesn't know.,chit-chat
can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand oh yesthat that is the worst of all,novel
i don't think so. i'm not sure what she's up to.,chit-chat
till i was in kent and saw so much both of mr darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam i was ignorant of the truth myself,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. did you ever find out who he was or what his real name was?,chit-chat
and when i returned home the shire was to leave meryton in a week or fortnights time,novel
"oh no, i'm sorry to hear that. did you have a good time there?",chit-chat
as that was the case neither jane to whom i related the whole nor i thought it necessary to make our knowledge public for of what use could it apparently be to anyone that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
and even when it was settled that lydia should go with mrs forster the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me,novel
i didn't realize that until after i finished the game. i was so mad at him.,chit-chat
that _she_ could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay. what did you do?,chit-chat
that such a consequence as _this_ should ensue you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts when they all removed to brighton therefore you had no reason i suppose to believe them fond of each other not the slightest,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm sorry you had to go through that.,chit-chat
i can remember no symptom of affection on either side and had anything of the kind been perceptible you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find a way to forgive yourself.,chit-chat
when first he entered the corps she was ready enough to admire him but so we all were,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm sure she was very proud of him.,chit-chat
every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular attention and consequently after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration her fancy for him gave way and others of the regiment who treated her with more distinction again became her favourites it may be easily believed that however little of novelty could be added to their fears hopes and conjectures on this interesting subject by its repeated discussion no other could detain them from it long during the whole of the journey,novel
"i've never heard of meryton, but i'm familiar with him. what's his name?",chit-chat
from elizabeths thoughts it was never absent,novel
i've never heard of elizabeths. what's his name? i'm not familiar with him.,chit-chat

that sounds like a lot of fun. did you get to go on a trip with them?,chit-chat
it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long expectations,novel
"that's a good point. i didn't think of it that way, but i guess it makes sense.",chit-chat
the little gardiners attracted by the sight of a chaise were standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock and when the carriage drove up to the door the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies in a variety of capers and frisks was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome,novel
"hello, how are you doing today? i just got back from a walk in the park.",chit-chat
elizabeth jumped out and after giving each of them a hasty kiss hurried into the vestibule where jane who came running downstairs from her mothers apartment immediately met her,novel
"hey jane, how are you doing today? i just got back from the vestibule.",chit-chat
elizabeth as she affectionately embraced her whilst tears filled the eyes of both lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been heard of the fugitives,novel

"i don't know, i guess it's because i've never been in a relationship before.",chit-chat
you look pale,novel
"i'm a bit pale, but i've got a fair skin tone. what about you?",chit-chat
how much you must have gone through her sister however assured her of her being perfectly well and their conversation which had been passing while mr and mrs gardiner were engaged with their children was now put an end to by the approach of the whole party,novel
"i went through her sister, but i didn't get to see her in person. it was a long time ago.",chit-chat
jane ran to her uncle and aunt and welcomed and thanked them both with alternate smiles and tears,novel
"hey jane, how are you doing today? i just got back from a long day at work.",chit-chat
when they were all in the drawingroom the questions which elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the others and they soon found that jane had no intelligence to give,novel
"that's a good point, i didn't think of it that way. i guess it's kind of hard to be smart when you don't know what you're doing.",chit-chat
the sanguine hope of good however which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her she still expected that it would all end well and that every morning would bring some letter either from lydia or her father to explain their proceedings and perhaps announce the marriage,novel

mrs bennet to whose apartment they all repaired after a few minutes conversation together received them exactly as might be expected with tears and lamentations of regret invectives against the villainous conduct of wickham and complaints of her own sufferings and illusage blaming everybody but the person to whose illjudging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get them fixed.,chit-chat
if i had been able said she to carry my point in going to brighton with all my family _this_ would not have happened but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her,novel
"oh no, i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she's doing better now.",chit-chat
why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight,novel
"i don't know, maybe they didn't want her to get hurt. i'm not sure.",chit-chat
i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after,novel
i don't know... i'm not sure what to do with her.,chit-chat
i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her but i was overruled as i always am,novel

do not give way to useless alarm added he though it is right to be prepared for the worst there is no occasion to look on it as certain,novel
that's a good point. i'm going to try to be more careful next time.,chit-chat
it is not quite a week since they left brighton,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get back on your feet soon.,chit-chat
in a few days more we may gain some news of them and till we know that they are not married and have no design of marrying do not let us give the matter over as lost,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find them soon.,chit-chat
as soon as i get to town i shall go to my brother and make him come home with me to gracechurch street and then we may consult together as to what is to be done oh my dear brother replied mrs bennet that is exactly what i could most wish for,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. i'm sure you'll have a great time.,chit-chat
and now do when you get to town find them out wherever they may be and if they are not married already _make_ them marry,novel
that's a good idea. i'm going to have to do that next time.,chit-chat
and as for wedding clothes do not let them wait for that but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them after they are married,novel
that's a good idea. i'll have to do that. thanks for the advice!,chit-chat
and above all things keep mr bennet from fighting,novel
"i'm not sure what mr bennet is, but i know he's a good guy.",chit-chat
tell him what a dreadful state i am inthat i am frightened out of my wits and have such tremblings such flutterings all over me such spasms in my side and pains in my head and such beatings at my heart that i can get no rest by night nor by day,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're doing better now. what's going on in your life?,chit-chat
and tell my dear lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me for she does not know which are the best warehouses,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i've never had that happen to me before.,chit-chat
oh brother how kind you are,novel
i'm very kind to him. he's my best friend and i love him very much.,chit-chat
i know you will contrive it all but mr gardiner though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause could not avoid recommending moderation to her as well in her hopes as her fears and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper who attended in the absence of her daughters,novel
i'm not sure i understand what you're saying. are you referring to the housekeeper who attended in the absence of her daughters?,chit-chat
though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family they did not attempt to oppose it for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants while they waited at table and judged it better that _one_ only of the household and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i've never heard of a seclusion like that before.",chit-chat
in the diningroom they were soon joined by mary and kitty who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before,novel
"wow, that must have been a lot of fun. did you have a good time with them?",chit-chat
one came from her books and the other from her toilette,novel
"oh wow, that's really interesting. did you find out who it was by chance?",chit-chat
the faces of both however were tolerably calm and no change was visible in either except that the loss of her favourite sister or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business had given something more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of kitty,novel
i'm so sorry to hear about your loss. i hope kitty is doing better now.,chit-chat
as for mary she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection soon after they were seated at table this is a most unfortunate affair and will probably be much talked of,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're right about the affair.,chit-chat
but we must stem the tide of malice and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation then perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying she added unhappy as the event must be for lydia we may draw from it this useful lessonthat loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable that one false step involves her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful and that she can not be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement but was too much oppressed to make any reply,novel
i'm not sure i understand what you're saying. are you saying that elizabeth's reputation is no less brittable than it is beautiful and that she can not be too much guard in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement but was too much oppressed to make any reply?,chit-chat
mary however continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you referring to mary 2 : 16?,chit-chat
in the afternoon the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making any inquiries which jane was equally eager to satisfy,novel
jane walked up to elizabeth and asked her if she wanted to make an inquiries with her.,chit-chat
after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event which elizabeth considered as all but certain and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible the former continued the subject by saying but tell me all and everything about it which i have not already heard,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
give me further particulars,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. what do you want to know about me?,chit-chat
what did colonel forster say,novel
i don't know. i'm not sure what colonel forster's name is.,chit-chat
had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement took place,novel
i don't think so. it's been a while since i've been there.,chit-chat
they must have seen them together for ever colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality especially on lydias side but nothing to give him any alarm,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think of that. i'll have to look into that.,chit-chat
i am so grieved for him,novel
"why are you grieved? i'm sure he's a great player, but i don't like him either.",chit-chat
his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost,novel
i'm glad to hear that. what did he do to get you to do that?,chit-chat
he _was_ coming to us in order to assure us of his concern before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland when that apprehension first got abroad it hastened his journey and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry,novel
"wow, that's pretty crazy. i'm glad he didn't get married.",chit-chat
did he know of their intending to go off,novel
"i don't think so, but i'm not sure if it was intentional or not.",chit-chat
had colonel forster seen denny himself yes but when questioned by _him_ denny denied knowing anything of their plan and would not give his real opinion about it,novel
that's terrible. i'm sorry you had to go through that. what happened?,chit-chat
he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying and from _that_ i am inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before and till colonel forster came himself not one of you entertained a doubt i suppose of their being really married how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains,novel
i don't think he was misunderstood. i think he just didn't want to admit he was wrong.,chit-chat
i felt a little uneasya little fearful of my sisters happiness with him in marriage because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right,novel
"oh no, i'm sorry to hear that. how long have you two been together?",chit-chat
my father and mother knew nothing of that they only felt how imprudent a match it must be,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
kitty then owned with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us that in lydias last letter she had prepared her for such a step,novel
that's awesome! i'm so happy for her. i hope she's doing well.,chit-chat
she had known it seems of their being in love with each other many weeks but not before they went to brighton no i believe not and did colonel forster appear to think ill of wickham himself,novel
that's interesting. i didn't know colonel forster thought he was going to die.,chit-chat
does he know his real character i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did,novel
"i'm not sure if he knows his real character, but i do know that he's a great actor.",chit-chat
he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant and since this sad affair has taken place it is said that he left meryton greatly in debt but i hope this may be false oh jane had we been less secret had we told what we knew of him this could not have happened perhaps it would have been better replied her sister,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find peace.,chit-chat
but to expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were seemed unjustifiable we acted with the best intentions could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydias note to his wife he brought it with him for us to see jane then took it from her pocketbook and gave it to elizabeth,novel
that's very nice of him. i'm glad he didn't do that to you.,chit-chat
these were the contents nind my dear harriet you will laugh when you know where i am gone and i can not help laughing myself at your surprise tomorrow morning as soon as i am missed,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find your way back home.,chit-chat
i am going to gretna green and if you can not guess with who i shall think you a simpleton for there is but one man in the world i love and he is an angel,novel
that's awesome! i'm sure you'll have a great time. what's your favorite color?,chit-chat
i should never be happy without him so think it no harm to be off,novel
that's a good attitude to have. i'm glad you have someone to be happy with.,chit-chat
you need not send them word at longbourn of my going if you do not like it for it will make the surprise the greater when i write to them and sign my name lydia wickham,novel
that's a good idea. i'll keep that in mind. thanks for the advice.,chit-chat
what a good joke it will be,novel
i hope so. it's been a long time since i've been in a relationship.,chit-chat
i can hardly write for laughing,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what do you do for fun? do you have any hobbies?,chit-chat
pray make my excuses to pratt for not keeping my engagement and dancing with him tonight,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find the right person.,chit-chat
tell him i hope he will excuse me when he knows all and tell him i will dance with him at the next ball we meet with great pleasure,novel
that's a great idea. i think i'll do that. i'm sure he'll appreciate it.,chit-chat
i shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn but i wish you would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up,novel
that would be so nice of you to do that. i'm sure she would appreciate it.,chit-chat
goodbye,novel
"hello, how are you? i just got back from a long day at work...",chit-chat
give my love to colonel forster,novel
what is your love for colonel forster? i'm sure he's a great man.,chit-chat
i hope you will drink to our good journey,novel
i hope so too. it's been a long time since i've been sober.,chit-chat
your affectionate friend lydia bennet oh thoughtless thoughtless lydia cried elizabeth when she had finished it,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
what a letter is this to be written at such a moment,novel
i know right? i can't even imagine what it would be like to be in that situation.,chit-chat
but at least it shows that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey,novel
that's true. i'm glad she didn't have to go through that.,chit-chat
whatever he might afterwards persuade her to it was not on her side a _scheme_ of infamy,novel
that's what i'm thinking too. i don't know what to do now.,chit-chat
my poor father,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did he do to make you feel that way?,chit-chat
how he must have felt it i never saw anyone so shocked,novel
he must have felt it. i don't think i've ever felt that way before.,chit-chat
he could not speak a word for full ten minutes,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. do you have any idea why he couldn't speak a word?,chit-chat
my mother was taken ill immediately and the whole house in such confusion oh jane cried elizabeth was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day i do not know i hope there was,novel
"oh no, i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay.",chit-chat
but to be guarded at such a time is very difficult,novel
"yes, it is. i'm trying to get better at it, but it's hard.",chit-chat
my mother was in hysterics and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. it's always good to help people in need.,chit-chat
but the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties your attendance upon her has been too much for you,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
you do not look well,novel
i don't think i look well either. i'm not sure what to do with myself.,chit-chat
oh that i had been with you,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do to make you feel that way?,chit-chat
you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone mary and kitty have been very kind and would have shared in every fatigue i am sure but i did not think it right for either of them,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get through it.,chit-chat
kitty is slight and delicate and mary studies so much that her hours of repose should not be broken in on,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get her to a good home soon.,chit-chat
my aunt philips came to longbourn on tuesday after my father went away and was so good as to stay till thursday with me,novel
that's so sweet of her. i'm so sorry to hear about your father.,chit-chat
she was of great use and comfort to us all and lady lucas has been very kind she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us and offered her services or any of her daughters if they could be of use to us she had better have stayed at home cried elizabeth perhaps she _meant_ well but under such a misfortune as this one can not see too little of ones neighbours,novel
that's so sweet of her. i'm glad she's doing well. i hope she feels better soon.,chit-chat
assistance is impossible condolence insufferable,novel
i agree. it's hard to help someone if you don't know what you're doing.,chit-chat
let them triumph over us at a distance and be satisfied she then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue while in town for the recovery of his daughter,novel
that's a good idea. i think i'll do that next time i see her.,chit-chat
he meant i believe replied jane to go to epsom the place where they last changed horses see the postilions and try if anything could be made out from them,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of that place. what's it called?,chit-chat
his principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham,novel
"i'm not sure what that means, but i hope it's a good one.",chit-chat
it had come with a fare from london and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and ladys removing from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make inquiries at clapham,novel
"wow, that must have been quite the experience. did you get on the train at all?",chit-chat
if he could anyhow discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare he determined to make inquiries there and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach,novel
that's a good idea. i'm sure he'd be able to find out.,chit-chat
i do not know of any other designs that he had formed but he was in such a hurry to be gone and his spirits so greatly discomposed that i had difficulty in finding out even so much as this illustration the post chapter xlviii,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. did you find out who he was before he left?,chit-chat
illustration the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr bennet the next morning but the post came in without bringing a single line from him,novel
what did mr bennet say to mr. bennet? what did he say to the post?,chit-chat
his family knew him to be on all common occasions a most negligent and dilatory correspondent but at such a time they had hoped for exertion,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's doing better now. what happened to him?,chit-chat
they were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to send but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he didn't.,chit-chat
mr gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off,novel
"wow, that's a long time ago. did he have to wait for the letters?",chit-chat
when he was gone they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on and their uncle promised at parting to prevail on mr bennet to return to longbourn as soon as he could to the great consolation of his sister who considered it as the only security for her husbands not being killed in a duel,novel
that's so sad. i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's doing better now.,chit-chat
mrs gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few days longer as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. it must have been hard for them to see each other.,chit-chat
she shared in their attendance on mrs bennet and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom,novel
that's great to hear. i'm glad she was able to share that with them.,chit-chat
their other aunt also visited them frequently and always as she said with the design of cheering and heartening them upthough as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of wickhams extravagance or irregularity she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. i've never heard of that before. do you have a source for that?",chit-chat
all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who but three months before had been almost an angel of light,novel
meryton seems like a good guy. i'm glad he's doing well for himself.,chit-chat
he was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place and his intrigues all honoured with the title of seduction had been extended into every tradesmans family,novel
"wow, that's crazy. i'm glad he didn't have to go through that.",chit-chat
everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness,novel
"wow, that's interesting. what did he look like, if you don't mind me asking?",chit-chat
elizabeth though she did not credit above half of what was said believed enough to make her former assurance of her sisters ruin still more certain and even jane who believed still less of it became almost hopeless more especially as the time was now come when if they had gone to scotland which she had never before entirely despaired of they must in all probability have gained some news of them,novel
that's a good point. i think elizabeth is a great character. she's one of my favorite characters.,chit-chat
mr gardiner left longbourn on sunday on tuesday his wife received a letter from him it told them that on his arrival he had immediately found out his brother and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street,novel
"oh wow, that's really interesting. i've never heard of that place before.",chit-chat
that mr bennet had been to epsom and clapham before his arrival but without gaining any satisfactory information and that he was now determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town as mr bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them on their first coming to london before they procured lodgings,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of mr bennet before. have you?,chit-chat
mr gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure but as his brother was eager in it he meant to assist him in pursuing it,novel
that's very nice of mr. gardiner. i'm sure he appreciated it.,chit-chat
he added that mr bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave london and promised to write again very soon,novel
i didn't know that. i'll have to check it out. what did he say about leaving london?,chit-chat
there was also a postscript to this effect i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out if possible from some of the young mans intimates in the regiment whether wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself,novel
that's interesting. i'm not familiar with the postscript. what's it about?,chit-chat
if there were anyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a clue as that it might be of essential consequence,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure if i could do it though.,chit-chat
at present we have nothing to guide us,novel
"that's true, but it's always nice to have something to look forward to.",chit-chat
colonel forster will i dare say do everything in his power to satisfy us on this head,novel
colonel forster will i dare say do everything in his power to satisfy us on this head.,chit-chat
but on second thoughts perhaps lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better than any other person elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved,novel
"that's a good point. i'm not sure if it's true, but i think it could be.",chit-chat
she had never heard of his having had any relations except a father and mother both of whom had been dead many years,novel
that's really sad. i'm sorry to hear that. what happened to her?,chit-chat
it was possible however that some of his companions in the shire might be able to give more information and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it the application was a something to look forward to,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think of that. i'll have to look into that.,chit-chat
every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get through it.,chit-chat
the arrival of letters was the first grand object of every mornings impatience,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. how long did it take for the letter to arrive?,chit-chat
through letters whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. what was the news of the success of the day?,chit-chat
but before they heard again from mr gardiner a letter arrived for their father from a different quarter from mr collins which as jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence she accordingly read and elizabeth who knew what curiosities his letters always were looked over her and read it likewise,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. i've never heard of that before. what is it about?",chit-chat
it was as follows my dear sir i feel myself called upon by our relationship and my situation in life to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get through it.,chit-chat
be assured my dear sir that mrs collins and myself sincerely sympathize with you and all your respectable family in your present distress which must be of the bitterest kind because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find peace.,chit-chat
no arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune or that may comfort you under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a parents mind,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i don't know what to do.,chit-chat
the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i can't imagine what that must have been like.,chit-chat
and it is the more to be lamented because there is reason to suppose as my dear charlotte informs me that this licentiousness of behaviour in your illustration to whom i have related the affair _copyright 1894 by george allen_ daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence though at the same time for the consolation of yourself and mrs bennet i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad or she could not be guilty of such an enormity at so early an age,novel
i don't think so. i think it's more likely that she's just a bad person.,chit-chat
howsoever that may be you are grievously to be pitied in which opinion i am not only joined by mrs collins but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter to whom i have related the affair,novel
i don't think i'm grievously being pitied. i think it's the fact that i've been lied to all my life.,chit-chat
they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others for who as lady catherine herself condescendingly says will connect themselves with such a family,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get through it.,chit-chat
and this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last november for had it been otherwise i must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're feeling better about it now.,chit-chat
let me advise you then my dear sir to console yourself as much as possible to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence,novel
i don't know if i could do that. i'm not sure if i'd be able to handle it.,chit-chat
i am dear sir etc etc,novel
i am dear sir etc is an american television series produced in the united states. have you seen it?,chit-chat
mr gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from colonel forster and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i've never heard of him. what was his answer?,chit-chat
it was not known that wickham had a single relation with whom he kept up any connection and it was certain that he had no near one living,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of wickham before. who is he?,chit-chat
his former acquaintance had been numerous but since he had been in the militia it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did he do to make you think he was in the militia?,chit-chat
there was no one therefore who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him,novel
that's a good point. it's hard to tell if someone is lying or not.,chit-chat
and in the wretched state of his own finances there was a very powerful motive for secrecy in addition to his fear of discovery by lydias relations for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of secrecy before. what's his name?,chit-chat
colonel forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at brighton,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's able to clear his expenses.,chit-chat
he owed a good deal in the town but his debts of honour were still more formidable,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's able to pay them back.,chit-chat
mr gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn family jane heard them with horror,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay. what happened?,chit-chat
a gamester she cried,novel
why did she cry? was it because she was a gamer or because she wanted to be one?,chit-chat
this is wholly unexpected i had not an idea of it mr gardiner added in his letter that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day which was saturday,novel
that's great news. i'm glad they're able to see each other.,chit-chat
rendered spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours he had yielded to his brotherinlaws entreaty that he would return to his family and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of a spiritless person before. have you?,chit-chat
when mrs bennet was told of this she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected considering what her anxiety for his life had been before,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope that mrs bennet is doing better now.,chit-chat
what,novel
i'm not sure what i want to do with my life. i don't know what to do.,chit-chat
is he coming home and without poor lydia she cried,novel
i don't think so. i'm not sure if he's going home or not.,chit-chat
sure he will not leave london before he has found them,novel
that's what i'm worried about. i don't want to lose him.,chit-chat
who is to fight wickham and make him marry her if he comes away as mrs gardiner began to wish to be at home it was settled that she and her children should go to london at the same time that mr bennet came from it,novel
i don't know if i could do that. i'm not sure how he would feel about that.,chit-chat
the coach therefore took them the first stage of their journey and brought its master back to longbourn,novel
that's a good way to look at it. it's nice to have a coach that you can rely on.,chit-chat
mrs gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world,novel
i didn't know that. that's so sad. i'm sorry to hear that.,chit-chat
his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece and the kind of halfexpectation which mrs gardiner had formed of their being followed by a letter from him had ended in nothing,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find peace in your life.,chit-chat
elizabeth had received none since her return that could come from pemberley,novel
i didn't know that. that's interesting. i wonder what happened to her.,chit-chat
the present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary nothing therefore could be fairly conjectured from _that_though elizabeth who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings was perfectly aware that had she known nothing of darcy she could have borne the dread of lydias infamy somewhat better,novel
i'm so sorry to hear about lydias infamy. what happened to her?,chit-chat

that's true. it's hard to live in a world where you don't know what you're talking about.,chit-chat
mr darcy had been at her sisters wedding,novel
"oh wow, that's pretty cool. i've never been to a wedding before.",chit-chat
it was exactly a scene and exactly among people where he had apparently least to do and least temptation to go,novel
i can't wait to see what happens next. it's going to be great.,chit-chat
conjectures as to the meaning of it rapid and wild hurried into her brain but she was satisfied with none,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
those that best pleased her as placing his conduct in the noblest light seemed most improbable,novel
i don't know about that. i'm not sure i've ever been able to put my conduct in the noblest light.,chit-chat
she could not bear such suspense and hastily seizing a sheet of paper wrote a short letter to her aunt to request an explanation of what lydia had dropped if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended,novel
that's really interesting. did you find out what lydia had dropped? i'm not sure if i'd trust her.,chit-chat
you may readily comprehend she added what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us and comparatively speaking a stranger to our family should have been amongst you at such a time,novel
that's a good way of looking at it. i don't know what to do now.,chit-chat
pray write instantly and let me understand itunless it is for very cogent reasons to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance not that i _shall_ though she added to herself and she finished the letter and my dear aunt if you do not tell me in an honourable manner i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out janes delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall elizabeth was glad of ittill it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction she had rather be without a confidante,novel
i'm so sorry to hear about your aunt. i hope she's doing well.,chit-chat
illustration i am sure she did not listen chapter lii,novel
i don't know what chapter lii is. i'm not familiar with it.,chit-chat
illustration elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she possibly could,novel
illustration elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she possibly could.,chit-chat
she was no sooner in possession of it than hurrying into the little copse where she was least likely to be interrupted she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be happy for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial,novel
that's pretty cool. what did she do to convince you that it didn't contain a denial?,chit-chat

have you ever been to right gracechurch street? it's a street in new york city.,chit-chat

"have you ever heard of 6666? it's a latin word for "" 66t "".",chit-chat
my dear niece i have just received your letter and shall devote this whole morning to answering it as i foresee that a _little_ writing will not comprise what i have to tell you,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope it all works out for you and your niece.,chit-chat
i must confess myself surprised by your application i did not expect it from _you_,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what made you not expect it? what did you expect?,chit-chat
dont think me angry however for i only mean to let you know that i had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on _your_ side,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
if you do not choose to understand me forgive my impertinence,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. do you mean that you don't understand what you're saying?,chit-chat
your uncle is as much surprised as i am and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done,novel
i don't think so. i think he's just trying to make me feel better about myself.,chit-chat
but if you are really innocent and ignorant i must be more explicit,novel
"that's a good way to look at it, but it's not always true.",chit-chat
on the very day of my coming home from longbourn your uncle had a most unexpected visitor,novel
"oh wow, that must have been so exciting! did you get to see him at all?",chit-chat
mr darcy called and was shut up with him several hours,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did mr darcy do to get you shut down?,chit-chat
it was all over before i arrived so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as _yours_ seems to have been,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do to get it all over again?,chit-chat
he came to tell mr gardiner that he had found out where your sister and mr wickham were and that he had seen and talked with them bothwickham repeatedly lydia once,novel
that's really interesting. did you find out who he was or what he was up to?,chit-chat
from what i can collect he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them,novel
that's really nice of him. i'm sure he's proud of you.,chit-chat
the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickhams worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him,novel
that makes a lot of sense. i don't think i've ever heard of such a person before.,chit-chat
he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did he do to make you feel that way?,chit-chat
his character was to speak for itself,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he was able to do that.,chit-chat
he called it therefore his duty to step forward and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself,novel
that's a good way to look at it. what evil was brought on by him?,chit-chat
if he _had another_ motive i am sure it would never disgrace him,novel
i don't think so. i think he's just trying to make a living.,chit-chat
he had been some days in town before he was able to discover them but he had something to direct his search which was more than _we_ had and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us,novel
that's interesting. what was the reason for his resolving to follow us? what was he searching for?,chit-chat
there is a lady it seems a mrs younge who was some time ago governess to miss darcy and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation though he did not say what,novel
that's awful. i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she's okay.,chit-chat
she then took a large house in edward street and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings,novel
"wow, that must have been a lot of work. how long have you been doing that?",chit-chat
this mrs younge was he knew intimately acquainted with wickham and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town,novel
that's really interesting. what did he do to make you think he did something like that?,chit-chat
but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted,novel
"that's true, but i'm not sure if it's a good thing or not.",chit-chat
she would not betray her trust i suppose without bribery and corruption for she really did know where her friend was to be found,novel
that's a good point. it's hard to believe that she didn't know where her friend was.,chit-chat
wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in london and had she been able to receive them into her house they would have taken up their abode with her,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of wickham. what's her name?,chit-chat
at length however our kind friend procured the wishedfor direction,novel
that's a good friend. what kind of friend did he procured the wishedfor direction with?,chit-chat
they were in street,novel
that's a good way to get out of the house. do you have any hobbies?,chit-chat
he saw wickham and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia,novel
"oh, that's interesting. i didn't know that. what did he do?",chit-chat
his first object with her he acknowledged had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her offering his assistance as far as it would go,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. what did he say to her that made her want to quit?",chit-chat
but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think of that. i'm glad he found her.,chit-chat
she cared for none of her friends she wanted no help of his she would not hear of leaving wickham,novel
that's sad. i'm sorry to hear that. what happened to wickham?,chit-chat
she was sure they should be married some time or other and it did not much signify when,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did she do to make you feel that way?,chit-chat
since such were her feelings it only remained he thought to secure and expedite a marriage which in his very first conversation with wickham he easily learnt had never been _his_ design,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i've never heard of wickham before. what's her name?",chit-chat
he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour which were very pressing and scrupled not to lay all the ill consequences of lydias flight on her own folly alone,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. it must have been very hard for him to leave.,chit-chat
he meant to resign his commission immediately and as to his future situation he could conjecture very little about it,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to work it out.,chit-chat
he must go somewhere but he did not know where and he knew he should have nothing to live on,novel
that's what i'm thinking. i don't know what to do with myself.,chit-chat
mr darcy asked why he did not marry your sister at once,novel
mr darcy asked why he didn't marry my sister once... i don't get it.,chit-chat
though mr bennet was not imagined to be very rich he would have been able to do something for him and his situation must have been benefited by marriage,novel
"i don't know much about mr bennet, but i do know that he was a very successful businessman.",chit-chat
but he found in reply to this question that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country,novel
"wow, that's amazing. i'm sure he's proud of himself for doing that.",chit-chat
under such circumstances however he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief,novel
that's a good point. it's hard for me to believe that he didn't know what he was doing.,chit-chat
they met several times for there was much to be discussed,novel
that's good to hear. i'm glad you're able to work things out.,chit-chat
wickham of course wanted more than he could get but at length was reduced to be reasonable,novel
i don't think he wanted more than he could get. he just didn't want to.,chit-chat
everything being settled between _them_ mr darcys next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it and he first called in gracechurch street the evening before i came home,novel
that's really nice of him. what did he do to make you comfortable with it?,chit-chat
but mr gardiner could not be seen and mr darcy found on further inquiry that your father was still with him but would quit town the next morning,novel
that's so sad. i'm sorry to hear that. what happened to him?,chit-chat
he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm not sure what to do now.,chit-chat
he did not leave his name and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business,novel
that's a bummer. i'm sorry to hear that. what did he do?,chit-chat
on saturday he came again,novel
that's awesome! did you have a good time? did you get to see him again?,chit-chat
your father was gone your uncle at home and as i said before they had a great deal of talk together,novel
my father was gone at home and as i said before they had a great deal of talk together,chit-chat
they met again on sunday and then _i_ saw him too,novel
that's a bummer. how long did it take for them to get back together?,chit-chat
it was not all settled before monday as soon as it was the express was sent off to longbourn,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get it back.,chit-chat
but our visitor was very obstinate,novel
"oh no, what happened? did you have to talk to them about it or did they just not care?",chit-chat
i fancy lizzy that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all,novel
i don't know much about obstinacy. what is it about him that makes you fancy?,chit-chat
he has been accused of many faults at different times but _this_ is the true one,novel
he has been accused of many faults at different times but * thiss * is the true one,chit-chat
nothing was to be done that he did not do himself though i am sure and i do not speak it to be thanked therefore say nothing about it your uncle would most readily have settled the whole,novel
"i don't know if he would have settled the whole thing, but i'm glad he did.",chit-chat
they battled it together for a long time which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad they were able to work it out.,chit-chat
but at last your uncle was forced to yield and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it which went sorely against the grain and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers and give the praise where it was due,novel
i think you're right. i think i'm going to write him a letter about it.,chit-chat
but lizzy this must go no further than yourself or jane at most,novel
i don't think lizzy is a good person. i think she's a terrible person.,chit-chat
you know pretty well i suppose what has been done for the young people,novel
"i know, it's hard to believe that there are still so many young people out there.",chit-chat
his debts are to be paid amounting i believe to considerably more than a thousand pounds another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_ and his commission purchased,novel
"wow, that's a lot of money. i hope he's able to pay it off.",chit-chat
the reason why all this was to be done by him alone was such as i have given above,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to work it out.,chit-chat
it was owing to him to his reserve and want of proper consideration that wickhams character had been so misunderstood and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was,novel
that's a good way to look at it. what did wickhams character do?,chit-chat
perhaps there was some truth in _this_ though i doubt whether _his_ reserve or _anybodys_ reserve can be answerable for the event,novel
that's a good point. i'll have to think about that. do you have a favorite event?,chit-chat
but in spite of all this fine talking my dear lizzy you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded if we had not given him credit for _another interest_ in the affair,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to forgive him.,chit-chat
when all this was resolved on he returned again to his friends who were still staying at pemberley but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place and all money matters were then to receive the last finish,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's doing well in the future.,chit-chat
i believe i have now told you everything,novel
that's good to hear. i'm glad you're able to tell me everything.,chit-chat
it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure,novel
i don't think i'll be able to afford it. i'm going to have to wait until next year.,chit-chat
lydia came to us and wickham had constant admission to the house,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you were able to get out of the house.,chit-chat
_he_ was exactly what he had been when i knew him in hertfordshire but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with _her_ behaviour while she stayed with us if i had not perceived by janes letter last wednesday that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it and therefore what i now tell you can give you no fresh pain,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to move on.,chit-chat
i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner representing to her the wickedness of what she had done and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to talk to her about it.,chit-chat
if she heard me it was by good luck for i am sure she did not listen,novel
that's what i'm thinking too. i don't know what to do.,chit-chat
i was sometimes quite provoked but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane and for their sakes had patience with her,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you were able to get them to forgive you.,chit-chat
mr darcy was punctual in his return and as lydia imformed you attended the wedding,novel
"i've never been to a wedding, but i'd like to go one day.",chit-chat
he dined with us the next day and was to leave town again on wednesday or thursday,novel
that's really nice of him. i hope you guys have a good time. what did you guys do?,chit-chat
will you be very angry with me my dear lizzy if i take this opportunity of saying what i was never bold enough to say before how much i like him,novel
i don't think i would be angry at all. lizzy is a great singer.,chit-chat
his behaviour to us has in every respect been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do to make him behave that way?,chit-chat
his understanding and opinions all please me he wants nothing but a little more liveliness and _that_ if he marry _prudently_ his wife may teach him,novel
that's a good idea. i'm sure he will learn a lot from her.,chit-chat
i thought him very sly he hardly ever mentioned your name,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to talk to him about it.,chit-chat
but slyness seems the fashion,novel
i agree. i think it's great that she's doing so well. i don't think i'd be able to live without her.,chit-chat
pray forgive me if i have been very presuming or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from p i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to forgive yourself soon.,chit-chat
a low phaeton with a nice little pair of ponies would be the very thing,novel
"i'm not sure what a phaeton is, but i've never heard of it.",chit-chat
but i must write no more,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. do you have any other hobbies that you are passionate about?,chit-chat
the children have been wanting me this half hour,novel
how old are they? i'm sure they're happy you're there for them.,chit-chat
yours very sincerely m,novel
i'm glad you think so. it's nice to have a good relationship with someone you love.,chit-chat
gardiner the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share,novel
"i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're feeling better now, gardiner.",chit-chat
the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr darcy might have been doing to forward her sisters matchwhich she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable and at the same time dreaded to be just from the pain of obligationwere proved beyond their greatest extent to be true,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to work things out.,chit-chat
he had followed them purposely to town he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise and where he was reduced to meet frequently meet reason with persuade and finally bribe the man whom he always most wished to avoid and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce,novel
"wow, that sounds like a lot of trouble. did you have to deal with the consequences of your actions?",chit-chat
he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did he do for a girl he couldn't regard or esteem?,chit-chat
her heart did whisper that he had done it for her,novel
that's a good way to look at it. it's good that he did it for her.,chit-chat
but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient when required to depend on his affection for her for a woman who had already refused him as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham,novel
i'm sorry you had to go through that. i hope you're doing better now.,chit-chat
brotherinlaw of wickham,novel
brotherinlaw of wickham is one of my favorite dishes. do you like it?,chit-chat
every kind of pride must revolt from the connection,novel
that's so true. i'm so proud of him for doing what he did.,chit-chat
he had to be sure done much,novel
"he did a lot of work, but it was a long time ago, so i don't know what happened.",chit-chat
she was ashamed to think how much,novel
i am sorry to hear that. what did she do to make you feel bad about it?,chit-chat
but he had given a reason for his interference which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief,novel
i don't think so. i think he was just trying to make himself feel better.,chit-chat
it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong he had liberality and he had the means of exercising it and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement she could perhaps believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned,novel
i don't think it's reasonable to feel that way. i think he should have known better.,chit-chat
it was painful exceedingly painful to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get a refund.,chit-chat
they owed the restoration of lydia her character everything to him,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get her back.,chit-chat
oh how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him,novel
i don't think i've ever seen a saucy speech. what was it about?,chit-chat
for herself she was humbled but she was proud of himproud that in a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better of himself,novel
that's a great way to look at it. i'm glad she was able to get the better of herself.,chit-chat
she read over her aunts commendation of him again and again,novel
that's awful. i'm sorry to hear that. what did she say to him?,chit-chat
it was hardly enough but it pleased her,novel
i'm sure it did. what did she do to make it seem like it wasn't enough?,chit-chat
she was even sensible of some pleasure though mixed with regret on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between mr darcy and herself,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
she was roused from her seat and her reflections by someones approach and before she could strike into another path she was overtaken by wickham,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you were able to get out of your comfort zone.,chit-chat
i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble my dear sister said he as he joined her,novel
i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble my dear sister said he as he joined her.,chit-chat
you certainly do she replied with a smile but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome i should be sorry indeed if it were,novel
"it's okay, i'm sure she'll get over it. i just don't know what to do.",chit-chat
_we_ were always good friends and now we are better true,novel
that's good to hear. it's always good to have a good relationship with your friends.,chit-chat
are the others coming out i do not know,novel
i don't think so. i'm not sure what they're going to do.,chit-chat
mrs bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to meryton,novel
that's awesome! i'm sure they're going to have a great time.,chit-chat
and so my dear sister i find from our uncle and aunt that you have actually seen pemberley she replied in the affirmative,novel
that's really sweet of her. i'm sure she's very proud of you.,chit-chat
i almost envy you the pleasure and yet i believe it would be too much for me or else i could take it in my way to newcastle,novel
i'm not sure i could do it. it's just not my cup of tea.,chit-chat
and you saw the old housekeeper i suppose,novel
"yes, i did. i was so mad at her for doing that. i felt so bad for her.",chit-chat
poor reynolds she was always very fond of me,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did she do to make you so fond of her?,chit-chat
but of course she did not mention my name to you yes she did and what did she say that you were gone into the army and she was afraid hadnot turned out well,novel
she didn't tell me my name. i was in the army for a long time.,chit-chat
at such a distance as _that_ you know things are strangely misrepresented certainly he replied biting his lips,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you referring to something i've never heard of before?,chit-chat
elizabeth hoped she had silenced him but he soon afterwards said i was surprised to see darcy in town last month,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you were able to get the hang of it.,chit-chat
we passed each other several times,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. how long did it take for you to see each other?,chit-chat
i wonder what he can be doing there perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh said elizabeth,novel
"i don't know much about elizabeth, but i do know that she is an american singer.",chit-chat
it must be something particular to take him there at this time of year undoubtedly,novel
"i'm sure it is. he's been here a long time, and i don't know what to do with him.",chit-chat
did you see him while you were at lambton,novel
"yes, i saw him at lambton. he was so nice and nice to me.",chit-chat
i thought i understood from the gardiners that you had yes he introduced us to his sister and do you like her very much i have heard indeed that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two,novel
i do like her a lot. i think she's a great addition to the family.,chit-chat
when i last saw her she was not very promising,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did she do to make you not want to see her?,chit-chat
i am very glad you liked her,novel

i hope she will turn out well i dare say she will she has got over the most trying age did you go by the village of kympton i do not recollect that we did i mention it because it is the living which i ought to have had,novel

i've been there a few times. it's a great place to relax and have a good time.,chit-chat
excellent parsonagehouse,novel

it would have suited me in every respect how should you have liked making sermons exceedingly well,novel
i didn't know what i was going to do with them. i was so scared.,chit-chat
i should have considered it as part of my duty and the exertion would soon have been nothing,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. do you have any other hobbies you like to do?,chit-chat
one ought not to repine but to be sure it would have been such a thing for me,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. why do you think it would have been such a thing for you?,chit-chat
the quiet the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas of happiness,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what kind of things do you want to do now?,chit-chat
but it was not to be,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're doing better now than you used to be.,chit-chat
did you ever hear darcy mention the circumstance when you were in kent i _have_ heard from authority which i thought _as good_ that it was left you conditionally only and at the will of the present patron you have,novel
i don't think i have heard that before. i'm sorry to hear that.,chit-chat
yes there was something in _that_ i told you so from the first you may remember i _did_ hear too that there was a time when sermonmaking was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders and that the business had been compromised accordingly you did,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm not sure if i've ever heard that before.,chit-chat
and it was not wholly without foundation,novel
i don't think i've ever had foundation before. i'm not sure what it is.,chit-chat
you may remember what i told you on that point when first we talked of it they were now almost at the door of the house for she had walked fast to get rid of him and unwilling for her sisters sake to provoke him she only said in reply with a goodhumoured smile come mr wickham we are brother and sister you know,novel

that was very nice of mr. wickham. what did you say to his sister elizabeth?,chit-chat
the day of his and lydias departure soon came and mrs bennet was forced to submit to a separation which as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth,novel

i'm sorry to hear that. why do you dread other peoples remarks elizabeth did not know what to make of it?,chit-chat
had she not seen him in derbyshire she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged but she still thought him partial to jane and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there _with_ his friends permission or being bold enough to come without it,novel

as the day of his arrival drew near i begin to be sorry that he comes at all said jane to her sister,novel

both sisters were uncomfortable enough,novel
"yeah, i'm not sure i'd want to be that close with my sister.",chit-chat

that's really interesting. i've never heard of mr darcy before. what's his name?,chit-chat
but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not yet be suspected by jane to whom she had never yet had courage to show mrs gardiners letter or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think of it that way. i think it's interesting that she was the one who found out about it.,chit-chat
to jane he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused and whose merits she had undervalued but to her own more extensive information he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits and whom she regarded herself with an interest if not quite so tender at least as reasonable and just as what jane felt for bingley,novel
that's a great way to look at it. i'm not sure i've ever thought about it that way before.,chit-chat
her astonishment at his comingat his coming to netherfield to longbourn and voluntarily seeking her again was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
the colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a minute with an additional glow and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken but she would not be secure,novel
"hello, how are you today? i just got back from a long day at the office.",chit-chat
let me first see how he behaves said she it will then be early enough for expectation she sat intently at work striving to be composed and without daring to lift up her eyes till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to work it out.,chit-chat
jane looked a little paler than usual but more sedate than elizabeth had expected,novel
i didn't see that. what did she look like? i'm not familiar with jane.,chit-chat
on the gentlemens appearing her colour increased yet she received them with tolerable ease and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did she do to make you feel that way?,chit-chat
elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow and sat down again to her work with an eagerness which it did not often command,novel
elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow and sat down again to work with an eagerness which it did not often command,chit-chat
she had ventured only one glance at darcy,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to work things out.,chit-chat
he looked serious as usual and she thought more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire than as she had seen him at pemberley,novel
that must have been really hard for him. i hope he was able to get over it.,chit-chat
but perhaps he could not in her mothers presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure if it's true though.,chit-chat
it was a painful but not an improbable conjecture,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope it wasn't too painful for you.,chit-chat
bingley she had likewise seen for an instant and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope it wasn't too embarrassing for him.,chit-chat
he was received by mrs bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her courtesy and address of his friend,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope he's going to be ok.,chit-chat
elizabeth particularly who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied,novel
i'm not familiar with that. what is it about her that makes you feel that way?,chit-chat
darcy after inquiring of her how mr and mrs gardiner dida question which she could not answer without confusionsaid scarcely anything,novel
"what did she say? i've never heard of her before, but i'm familiar with her.",chit-chat
he was not seated by her perhaps that was the reason of his silence but it had not been so in derbyshire,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure why he didn't say something.,chit-chat
there he had talked to her friends when he could not to herself,novel
that's not good. i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's doing better now.,chit-chat
but now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice and when occasionally unable to resist the impulse of curiosity she raised her eyes to his face she as often found him looking at jane as at herself and frequently on no object but the ground,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please than when they last met were plainly expressed,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i don't think i've ever felt that way before.,chit-chat
she was disappointed and angry with herself for being so,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did she do to make you feel that way?,chit-chat
could i expect it to be otherwise said she,novel
i don't think so. it's been a while since i've seen her.,chit-chat
yet why did he come she was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself and to him she had hardly courage to speak,novel
i don't know... i'm not sure. maybe he just didn't feel like talking to her?,chit-chat
she inquired after his sister but could do no more,novel
that's what i'm thinking. i don't know what to do now.,chit-chat
it is a long time mr bingley since you went away said mrs bennet,novel

i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to come back soon.,chit-chat

"i don't know what that means, but i hope it's not true too.",chit-chat
a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood since you went away,novel
that's true. it's been a long time since i've been away.,chit-chat

"i don't think so. i think he has a lot of friends, but he doesn't know them.",chit-chat
it drew from her however the exertion of speaking which nothing else had so effectually done before and she asked bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of bingley before. who is she?,chit-chat
a few weeks he believed,novel
that's a long time. how long did it take for him to realize he was wrong?,chit-chat

i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you talking about the same thing?,chit-chat
at that instant she felt that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i can't imagine how hard that must have been for her.,chit-chat
the first wish of my heart said she to herself is never more to be in company with either of them,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope things work out for you and your family.,chit-chat
their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this,novel
"i don't know about you, but i've never been in a situation where i couldn't afford to.",chit-chat

they then went away,novel
that's what i'm worried about. i don't know what to do with myself.,chit-chat
mrs bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day but though she always kept a very good table she did not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year,novel

"wow, that's really interesting. i've never been to a diningroom before.",chit-chat
her prudent mother occupied by the same ideas forbore to invite him to sit by herself,novel

"wow, that's really interesting. i'm not familiar with bingley. what does she look like?",chit-chat
his behaviour to her sister was such during dinnertime as showed an admiration of her which though more guarded than formerly persuaded elizabeth that if left wholly to himself janes happiness and his own would be speedily secured,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
though she dared not depend upon the consequence she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad she didn't.,chit-chat
it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast for she was in no cheerful humour,novel

elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a fan of elizabeth. i think she's a bit of a hypocrite.",chit-chat
they shook hands with great cordiality and then till her sister came down she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness and of janes perfections and in spite of his being a lover elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded because they had for basis the excellent understanding and superexcellent disposition of jane and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. i didn't know there was a connection between jane and jane.",chit-chat

i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find someone else.,chit-chat

and will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement i will make no promise of the kind miss bennet i am shocked and astonished,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get through it.,chit-chat
i expected to find a more reasonable young woman,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. do you think you'll find someone more reasonable?,chit-chat
but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever recede,novel
i don't think i will ever recede. i'm not sure what i want to do with my life.,chit-chat

that's a good attitude to have. i'm glad you're not afraid of anything.,chit-chat
your ladyship wants mr darcy to marry your daughter but would my giving you the wishedfor promise make _their_ marriage at all more probable,novel
my ladyship wants mr. darcy to marry my daughter but would my giving you the wishedfor promise make marriage at all more probable,chit-chat
supposing him to be attached to me would _my_ refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin,novel

allow me to say lady catherine that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was illjudged,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. what's frivolous about it?,chit-chat
you have widely mistaken my character if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these,novel

you refuse then to oblige me,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you referring to the fact that you refuse to oblige me?,chit-chat
you refuse to obey the claims of duty honour and gratitude,novel
i don't think that's true. i think it's because i've never been in a situation like that before.,chit-chat

"that's a good way to look at it, but i don't want to ruin him.",chit-chat
no principle of either would be violated by my marriage with mr darcy,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
and with regard to the resentment of his family or the indignation of the world if the former _were_ excited by his marrying me it would not give me one moments concernand the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn and this is your real opinion,novel

this is your final resolve,novel
i hope so. it's been a long time since i've done anything like that.,chit-chat

i came to try you,novel
that's awesome! i'm so proud of you! i hope you have a great day!,chit-chat
i hoped to find you reasonable but depend upon it i will carry my point in this manner lady catherine talked on till they were at the door of the carriage when turning hastily round she added i take no leave of you miss bennet,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get back on your feet soon.,chit-chat
i send no compliments to your mother,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do to make her feel that way?,chit-chat
you deserve no such attention,novel
"why do you say that? i'm not trying to be mean, i just don't know what to say.",chit-chat
i am most seriously displeased elizabeth made no answer and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house walked quietly into it herself,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do to convince her to come back?,chit-chat
she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded upstairs,novel
that must have been scary. did you get out of the car and get back in the car?,chit-chat
her mother impatiently met her at the door of her dressingroom to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself,novel
"i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she's feeling better now, though.",chit-chat
she did not choose it said her daughter she would go she is a very finelooking woman,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she's able to make it through.,chit-chat
and her calling here was prodigiously civil,novel
i'm glad she was civil. it's always good to be civil to people.,chit-chat
for she only came i suppose to tell us the collinses were well,novel
that's nice of you to tell her that. i'm sure she'll appreciate that.,chit-chat
she is on her road somewhere i dare say and so passing through meryton thought she might as well call on you,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to talk to her about it.,chit-chat
i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you lizzy elizabeth was forced to give in to a little falsehood here for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible,novel
that's what i was thinking too. i don't know what to say to her.,chit-chat
illustration but now it comes out chapter lvii,novel
i've never heard of illustration but i'll look into it. what's it about?,chit-chat
illustration the discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into could not be easily overcome nor could she for many hours learn to think of it less than incessantly,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay. what happened?,chit-chat
lady catherine it appeared had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr darcy,novel
oh no! i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay.,chit-chat
it was a rational scheme to be sure,novel
that's what i'm thinking. i don't know what to do now.,chit-chat
but from what the report of their engagement could originate elizabeth was at a loss to imagine till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of bingley and _her_ being the sister of jane was enough at a time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another to supply the idea,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think of that. i guess that makes sense.,chit-chat
she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together,novel
that's a good way to look at it. how long have you been married for?,chit-chat
and her neighbours at lucas lodge therefore for through their communication with the collinses the report she concluded had reached lady catherine had only set _that_ down as almost certain and immediate which _she_ had looked forward to as possible at some future time,novel
"wow, that's amazing. i'm glad she was able to get through it.",chit-chat
in revolving lady catherines expressions however she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
from what she had said of her resolution to prevent the marriage it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared not pronounce,novel
i don't think i've ever heard of that. i'll have to look into it.,chit-chat
she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt or his dependence on her judgment but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do and it was certain that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_ whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own his aunt would address him on his weakest side,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
with his notions of dignity he would probably feel that the arguments which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous contained much good sense and solid reasoning,novel
i don't think so. i think he would have felt the same way about elizabeth.,chit-chat
if he had been wavering before as to what he should do which had often seemed likely the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i think you're right about that.,chit-chat
in that case he would return no more,novel
that's what i'm thinking. i don't know what to do with myself.,chit-chat
lady catherine might see him in her way through town and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way,novel
that's a great idea! i'm sure he'll have a great time.,chit-chat
if therefore an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days she added i shall know how to understand it,novel
that's a good idea. i don't know how to deal with people like that.,chit-chat

that's very kind of you to say. thank you for your kind words. i appreciate it.,chit-chat

will you tell me how long you have loved him it has been coming on so gradually that i hardly know when it began but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley another entreaty that she would be serious however produced the desired effect and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment,novel
i've been with him for a few years now. it's been a long time.,chit-chat
when convinced on that article miss bennet had nothing further to wish,novel

but lizzy you have been very sly very reserved with me,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did lizzy do to make you feel that way?,chit-chat
how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton,novel
pemberley and lambton were the only ones i didn't tell about.,chit-chat
i owe all that i know of it to another not to you elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you referring to something i don't know about?,chit-chat
she had been unwilling to mention bingley and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend but now she would no longer conceal from her his share in lydias marriage,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she's able to get over it.,chit-chat
all was acknowledged and half the night spent in conversation,novel
that's a bummer. how long did it take for you to talk to them?,chit-chat
good gracious cried mrs bennet as she stood at a window the next morning if that disagreeable mr darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did mrs bennet do to make you cry?,chit-chat
what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here,novel
i don't know. i guess he just doesn't want to be here anymore.,chit-chat
i had no notion but he would go ashooting or something or other and not disturb us with his company,novel
that's terrible. i'm sorry you had to go through that. what did you do?,chit-chat
what shall we do with him,novel
"i'm not sure yet, but i think i'll keep him for a while.",chit-chat
lizzy you must walk out with him again that he may not be in bingleys way elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet,novel
i don't think lizzy is in bingleys at all. i think he's just a jerk.,chit-chat
as soon as they entered bingley looked at her so expressively and shook hands with such warmth as left no doubt of his good information and he soon afterwards said aloud mrs,novel
that's really nice of him. i'm sure he's a great person.,chit-chat
bennet have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again today i advise mr darcy and lizzy and kitty said mrs bennet to walk to oakham mount this morning,novel
i don't think lizzy is going to lose her way again. lizzy will win again.,chit-chat
it is a nice long walk and mr darcy has never seen the view it may do very well for the others replied mr bingley but i am sure it will be too much for kitty,novel
i'm sure it's going to be a lot of fun. i hope it does well.,chit-chat
wont it kitty kitty owned that she had rather stay at home,novel
i don't think so. i'm not sure if it's a cat or a dog.,chit-chat
darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount and elizabeth silently consented,novel
"i've never seen the mount, but i'd love to see elizabeth's view.",chit-chat
as she went upstairs to get ready mrs bennet followed her saying i am quite sorry lizzy that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself but i hope you will not mind it,novel
i don't mind it at all. i'm glad lizzy didn't do it.,chit-chat
it is all for janes sake you know and there is no occasion for talking to him except just now and then so do not put yourself to inconvenience during their walk it was resolved that mr bennets consent should be asked in the course of the evening elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mothers,novel
that's a good point. i think i'm going to talk to him about it.,chit-chat
she could not determine how her mother would take it sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man but whether she were violently set against the match or violently delighted with it it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense and she could no more bear that mr darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy than the first vehemence of her disapprobation,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get through it.,chit-chat
in the evening soon after mr bennet withdrew to the library she saw mr darcy rise also and follow him and her agitation on seeing it was extreme,novel
"wow, that must have been scary. i hope she was able to get out of there.",chit-chat
she did not fear her fathers opposition but he was going to be made unhappy and that it should be through her means that _she_ his favourite child should be distressing him by her choice should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her was a wretched reflection and she sat in misery till mr darcy appeared again when looking at him she was a little relieved by his smile,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get through it.,chit-chat
in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty and while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper go to your father he wants you in the library she was gone directly,novel
"oh my god, that's terrible. i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay.",chit-chat
her father was walking about the room looking grave and anxious,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope he was able to get over it.,chit-chat
lizzy said he what are you doing,novel
lizzy said what? i don't know what you're talking about. what did lizzy say?,chit-chat
are you out of your senses to be accepting this man,novel
i don't know. i'm not sure if he's a good person or not.,chit-chat
have not you always hated him how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable her expressions more moderate,novel
i don't think i've ever hated him. he's a good guy.,chit-chat
it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give but they were now necessary and she assured him with some confusion of her attachment to mr darcy,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i didn't think of it that way.,chit-chat
or in other words you are determined to have him,novel
that's a good way of looking at it. i'm not sure what i want to do with him.,chit-chat
he is rich to be sure and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure if i'll be able to trust him.,chit-chat
but will they make you happy have you any other objection said elizabeth than your belief of my indifference none at all,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you saying that you don't believe in elizabeth?,chit-chat
we all know him to be a proud unpleasant sort of man but this would be nothing if you really liked him i do i do like him she replied with tears in her eyes i love him,novel
i don't think he's unpleasant. i think he just doesn't care.,chit-chat
indeed he has no improper pride,novel
i don't think so. i'm sure he has a lot of pride though.,chit-chat
he is perfectly amiable,novel
that's good to hear. i'm not sure what to do with my life.,chit-chat
you do not know what he really is then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms lizzy said her father i have given him my consent,novel
i don't know what he is. i'm not sure what he's up to.,chit-chat
he is the kind of man indeed to whom i should never dare refuse anything which he condescended to ask,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he didn't.,chit-chat
i now give it to _you_ if you are resolved on having him,novel
that's a good idea. i think i'm going to give it to him.,chit-chat
but let me advise you to think better of it,novel
"that's what i'm trying to do, but i don't know what to do.",chit-chat
i know your disposition lizzy,novel
what do you mean by that? i'm not sure what you mean. are you talking about me?,chit-chat
i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable unless you truly esteemed your husband unless you looked up to him as a superior,novel
"i did look up to him, but i didn't think he was superior at all.",chit-chat
your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by unequal marriage. are you talking about marriage?,chit-chat
you could scarcely escape discredit and misery,novel
that's a good idea. i'll have to try that. what's your favorite team?,chit-chat
my child let me not have the grief of seeing _you_ unable to respect your partner in life,novel
that's a tough thing to deal with. how long have you been with your child?,chit-chat
you know not what you are about elizabeth still more affected was earnest and solemn in her reply and at length by repeated assurances that mr darcy was really the object of her choice by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day but had stood the test of many months suspense and enumerating with energy all his good qualities she did conquer her fathers incredulity and reconcile him to the match,novel
i don't know what you're talking about. i'm sorry you feel that way.,chit-chat
well my dear said he when she ceased speaking i have no more to say,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
if this be the case he deserves you,novel
i'm not sure. i don't know if he really does or not. it's hard to tell.,chit-chat
i could not have parted with you my lizzy to anyone less worthy to complete the favourable impression she then told him what mr darcy had voluntarily done for lydia,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
he heard her with astonishment,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never heard of astonishment before. what's it like?,chit-chat
this is an evening of wonders indeed,novel
it really is. i can't wait to see what they come up with next week.,chit-chat
and so darcy did everything made up the match gave the money paid the fellows debts and got him his commission,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad he didn't do that to me.,chit-chat
so much the better,novel
"i know, it's so nice to be able to go out and have a good time.",chit-chat
it will save me a world of trouble and economy,novel
that's a good attitude to have. i'm sure you'll be fine.,chit-chat

that's so sweet of you! i'm sure he'll love you forever!,chit-chat
everything was too recent for gaiety but the evening passed tranquilly away there was no longer anything material to be dreaded and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're feeling better now. what happened?,chit-chat
when her mother went up to her dressingroom at night she followed her and made the important communication,novel
"oh wow, that must have been scary. what did she do to make the important communication?",chit-chat
its effect was most extraordinary for on first hearing it mrs bennet sat quite still and unable to utter a syllable,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she's doing better now. what happened?,chit-chat
nor was it under many many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them,novel
