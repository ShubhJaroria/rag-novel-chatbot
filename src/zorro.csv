through the surf they splashed half naked carrying naught except their weapons and no weapons save their cutlasses,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. do you have any hobbies that you like to do?,chit-chat

"that's a funny way to put it, but i don't think it's right.",chit-chat
to his wonder barbados grasped his arm so that sanchez thought the bone must break,novel
that's so sad. i'm glad he's ok. what happened to him?,chit-chat
enough of that barbados cried,novel

i love to protect myself barbados replied,novel
"have you ever been to barbados? i've never been, but i'd love to go.",chit-chat
it is an ill thing to assault a _fray_ if it can be avoided he stopped speaking for a moment and seemed to shiver throughout the length and breadth of his gigantic frame,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i don't think i could do that.,chit-chat
i had a friend once who struck a _fray_ he added in a whisper,novel
"wow, that's pretty crazy. did he get in trouble for it or was he able to get away with it?",chit-chat
i do not like to remember what happened to him,novel
"i'm sorry to hear that. what happened to him, if you don't mind me asking?",chit-chat
forward inland they tramped mile after mile keeping to the ca単ons following an _arroyo_ now and then dodging from dark spot to dark spot while barbados growled curses at the bright moon and sanchez continually admonished the men behind to keep silent,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. do you have any other hobbies you like to do?,chit-chat
it was a journey they disliked but they liked to think of the loot they would find at the end of it,novel
that's a good way to think about it. what did you think of the loot?,chit-chat

besides barbados and sanchez few of them had seen the town,novel
"i've never been to barbados, but i'd love to go there one day.",chit-chat
pirates had been treated harshly there when they had wandered inland,novel
i'm not sure what you're talking about. are you talking about the united states?,chit-chat
but now something had happened it appeared that made a raid on the town a comparatively safe enterprise,novel
oh no! that's terrible! i'm so sorry that happened to you. i hope you're okay.,chit-chat
an hour before dawn they stumbled across a native caught him as he started to flee and left his lifeless body behind,novel

they had covered ground well,novel

barbados a little way aside consulted his poor map once more and then called sanchez to his side,novel
"i don't know much about barbados, but i know it's a country in the caribbean.",chit-chat
since we may have to split our force it were well that you knew more of this business he said,novel

"i've never heard of barbados, but i'm sure it's a fun place to visit.",chit-chat

i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you have a safe place to stay.,chit-chat
it will be necessary perhaps to steal horses and possibly a _carreta_ or two in which to carry the loot,novel

the town will be wide open for us my friend there is a _presidio_ in reina de los angeles and where there is a _presidio_ there are soldiers sanchez reminded him,novel

i am not afraid of the soldiers,novel
"that's good to hear. what do you do for a living, if you don't mind me asking?",chit-chat

i've never heard of se単oritaos. what's his name?,chit-chat
but in that awful moment when he stood upon the plank looking first at the evil faces of barbados and sanchez and then at the agonized countenance of se単orita lolita pulido he knew what torture meant,novel
i can't imagine what that must have been like. i don't think i could do that.,chit-chat
it was not that se単or zorro was afraid of death in itselfa thing that must come to every human being in the end,novel
i don't think se単or zorro was afraid of death. i think it was more of a fear of the unknown.,chit-chat
but his agony came from a knowledge of what he would leave behind when he took the plunge into the sea,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think of that. i wonder what he would have done if he knew what he was going to do.,chit-chat
the woman he had hoped to make his bride his friends his father his estatehe was leaving them all for the great unknown,novel
that's so sad. i'm sorry you had to go through that. i hope you're doing better now.,chit-chat
and he was young and had not lived his fill of life,novel

besides he was leaving the _se単orita_ in grave danger,novel

he could only hope that his friends in the vessel behind would be able to be of service to her and that they would know how to avenge him,novel

barbados gave his last mocking laugh and se単or zorro felt the plank tipping,novel

he felt himself losing his balance,novel
that's a good way to look at it. it's hard to lose your balance when you don't know what you're doing.,chit-chat
the heavy weight on his wrists was almost bending him backward,novel
"oh wow, i didn't see that. i'm glad he's okay.",chit-chat
he knew how swiftly it would carry him down into the depths of the sea,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he didn't get hurt.,chit-chat
then would come a brief and useless struggle he supposed a moment of horrorand the end,novel
that's what i was thinking. it's a shame that he didn't do anything about it.,chit-chat
his eyes met those of the _se単orita_ yet again,novel
i've never heard of the se単oritae. what's it about?,chit-chat
and then it seemed that everything gave way beneath him and he shot downward,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
there came a splash of water as he struck the surfacehe felt its sudden chilland then the waves closed over his head,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad you were able to get out of the water.,chit-chat
he was a famous swimmer but no man can swim with a heavy bar of metal tied to his wrists and those wrists lashed behind his back,novel
"wow, that's crazy. i didn't know he was a famous swimmer. did he have a lot of medals?",chit-chat
mechanically se単or zorro protected himself as he struck the water as though for a deep dive,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never heard of se単or zorro before.,chit-chat
he drew air into his lungs until it seemed that they would burst,novel
"oh wow, that's scary. i hope he didn't have a heart attack.",chit-chat
he kicked in vain against the downpulling power of the heavy weight,novel
"wow, that's impressive. i've never done that before. how did you do it?",chit-chat
down and down he went into the depths until the light from the surface faded and he found himself in darkness,novel
that's so sad. i'm sorry to hear that. what happened to him?,chit-chat
se単or zorro prayed and worked at the same instant,novel
i have never heard of se単or zorro. what does he do for a living?,chit-chat
he jerked his wrists from side to side behind his back trying to force them apart,novel
"oh my god, that's terrible. i'm so sorry to hear that. what happened?",chit-chat
he expelled a tiny bit of air now and then as he descended but retained it as much as possible,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad he didn't have to go to the hospital.,chit-chat
often he had played at remaining as long as possible beneath water but it is one thing to do so when a man has the knowledge that he can spring to the surface at any time and quite another when he has reason to believe that he never will reach the surface again at all,novel
that's a good way to look at it. it's hard to believe that he never will reach the surface again.,chit-chat
yet he continued to struggle as he shot downward,novel
that's what i was thinking. i'm glad he's doing better now.,chit-chat
red flashes were before his eyes now and a multitude of faces and scenes seemed to flit before him,novel
i've never seen a flash before. what's it like to be a flash?,chit-chat
in that awful instant he relived half his life,novel
"i know, i was so sad. i can't imagine what that must have been like.",chit-chat
_dios_ he thought,novel
"i'm not sure what that means, but i've never heard it before. what does it mean?",chit-chat
if this be death another tug he gave at his wrists,novel
that's what i'm thinking too. i don't know what to do.,chit-chat
the man who had lashed the heavy weight there had not done his work well,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i've had that happen to me before. it's awful.,chit-chat
perhaps he was too busy watching barbados and fearing him,novel
i don't think so. i think he just wanted to get away from his family.,chit-chat
perhaps he had held a sneaking admiration for this se単or zorro who had offered battle to an entire ships company,novel
"that's a good guess, but i don't think so. i'm not sure why he would do that.",chit-chat
however the rope that held the weight gave a trifle,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to recover from it.,chit-chat
se単or zorro in his agony realized that,novel
se単or zorro is one of my favorites. he is such a great actor.,chit-chat
he tugged again and then pressed his palms close together and drew in his wrists as much as possible,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad he didn't get hurt too bad.,chit-chat
the heavy weight dragging downward pulled the loose loop over the wrists and hands,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're doing better now. what happened?,chit-chat
zorro felt an immediate relief,novel
i love zorro! he's my favorite character. what's your favorite character?,chit-chat
he realized what had happened,novel
that's what i'm thinking. i don't know what to do now.,chit-chat
and then he began his battle to reach the surface,novel
that's awesome! i'm so happy for him. i hope he's doing well.,chit-chat
the weight was gone but his wrists were still lashed together behind his back,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope he's doing better now though.,chit-chat
he kicked and struggled and shot upward,novel
that's not good. i hope he's better now. what did he do?,chit-chat
he expelled more of the precious air his lungs retained,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad to hear that.,chit-chat
his chest was burning his ears were ringing he was almost unconscious because of the pressure of the water he had been forced to endure,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope he's ok. what happened to him?,chit-chat
he saw a glimmer of light but knew that the surface was yet far away,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he didn't get hurt.,chit-chat
and it occurred to him that even the surface did not mean life,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you referring to the fact that the surface does not mean life?,chit-chat
for his wrists were yet bound behind him and he was miles from the shore,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope he's doing better now. what happened to him?,chit-chat
on he went up and up struggling and fighting,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
he jerked at his wrists until they were raw and bleeding but to no avail,novel
"oh my god, that's terrible. i'm so sorry to hear that. what did he do?",chit-chat
those who had lashed his wrists had done better than the one who had fastened the weight to them,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're doing better than that.,chit-chat
and finally he gave a last struggle a last kick and felt the blessed air striking upon his face,novel
i can't wait to see what he does next. i'm sure he'll do great.,chit-chat
he fought to get into the proper position for resting as much as he could,novel
that's good to hear. i'm glad he was able to get in the proper position.,chit-chat
he kept afloat and he drew in great gasps of air and finally reduced his breathing to normal,novel
that's awesome! i'm glad he's doing better now. what did he do?,chit-chat
and then as he rose on the crest of a wave he looked around as well as he could,novel
that's awesome! i'm glad he was able to do that. i've never seen a wave like that before.,chit-chat
the pirate ship was some distance away sailing slowly before a gentle breeze,novel
"oh wow, that must have been exciting! did you get to see any of the ships?",chit-chat
se単or zorro found himself floating in her wake,novel
i love se単or zorro. he's my favorite character in the series.,chit-chat
he could see men rushing around her deck and up into her rigging but at the distance could not guess their tasks,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm not sure i could do that.,chit-chat
the wave dropped him and lifted him again spinning him halfway around,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never seen a wave like that before. what kind of wave is it?,chit-chat
se単or zorro gasped at the risk of swallowing a portion of salt water,novel
i've never heard of se単or zorro before. what's his name?,chit-chat
bearing down upon him was the other craft the one with the gigantic z up on the sail,novel
that's so cool! i've never heard of that before. what's the name of the craft?,chit-chat
zorro saw that he was directly in her path,novel
i love zorro! he's such a great character. what's your favorite part about him?,chit-chat
not much hope burned in his breast yet the spirit of combat still lived,novel
"i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's doing better now, though.",chit-chat
he would not give up so long as there was the slightest chance,novel
that's good to hear. i'm glad you have a good relationship with him.,chit-chat
he would fightfightuntil exhausted he sank for the last time toward the bottom of the sea,novel
"wow, that's impressive. i'm sure he's proud of you for doing that.",chit-chat
those on the approaching ship did not see him for they were watching the pirate craft and preparing for the battle that was to come,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never been on a ship before. what kind of battle was it?,chit-chat
he hailed those on board but his voice was drowned by the roar of the water against the schooners bows,novel
that's so sad. i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's feeling better now.,chit-chat
he saw that she would strike him and kicked frantically to work himself to one side of the track she was following,novel
"oh wow, that's pretty crazy. i'm glad he didn't get hurt.",chit-chat
another glance ahead at the pirate craft convinced him that the schooner would not change her course,novel
oh no! what did he do to make you think he was going to change her course?,chit-chat
once more he tugged at his bonds to no avail,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
he felt himself drawn in toward the schooners bows and fought against the pull of the water helplessly,novel
"that's pretty cool. i've never been to a schooners game, but i'd like to go one day.",chit-chat
he was picked up hurled forward whirled around,novel
that's good to hear. i'm glad he's doing well for himself.,chit-chat
had he saved himself from the depths he wondered to be crushed senseless by the bow of the craft that carried his friends,novel
i don't think so. i'm not sure if he saved himself or not.,chit-chat
then she was upon him,novel
"that's what i thought at first, but then i realized it's not true.",chit-chat
he rose with the crest of a wave and was hurled at the bow,novel
that's so cool! did he get hurt at all? was he hurt in any way?,chit-chat
he saw an anchor chain that was loosely looped and a dragging line,novel
"wow, that's impressive. i've never seen a drag line like that before.",chit-chat
if he could but catch one of those and make his way to the deck there might be some chance,novel
"that's what i'm thinking, but i don't know what to do.",chit-chat
once more the sea whirled him and cast him forward,novel
that's so cool! i've never heard of that before. what's it about?,chit-chat
he came against the swinging loop of anchor chain with a crash grasped it was lifted and dropped but held on,novel
"wow, that's impressive. i'm glad you were able to get out of there.",chit-chat
for a moment he rested panting realizing how precarious was his position,novel
that's a good way to look at it. what did you do to make him feel better?,chit-chat
he threw one leg around the swinging chain,novel
"oh wow, that's impressive. i've never done that before. how long did it take him to do that?",chit-chat
how to reach the bowsprit he could not fathom,novel
"i'm not sure how to reach the bowsprit, but i know how to hold my breath.",chit-chat
those above would pay no attention to him and could not hear him if he hailed,novel
that's what i was thinking. i don't know why they would do that.,chit-chat
and to climb that swinging loop of chain would be a task for an athlete with his hands unbound,novel
i don't think i'd be able to do that. i'm not very athletic.,chit-chat
the bow of the ship dipped and se単or zorro felt himself soused beneath the water for an instant,novel
i've never heard of se単or zorro. what's his name?,chit-chat
he gripped the chain with his hands and his leg and fought to maintain his position,novel
that's really cool. i've never seen a fight like that before. what was the fight about?,chit-chat
his arms were aching and the chain had cut through his clothing already and was chafing at his leg,novel
oh no! i hope he didn't get hurt. i've had that happen to me before.,chit-chat
once more the bow dipped and zorro slipped a few feet along the chain unable to stop his descent,novel
"wow, that must have been scary. what did you do to get him out of the way?",chit-chat
he gripped with his leg again,novel
oh no! that's terrible. i hope he's ok. i'm sure he'll be fine.,chit-chat
his hands came to a stop and he realized that the rope that bound them had found an obstruction,novel
oh no! that's terrible. i hope he was able to get out of there quickly.,chit-chat
zorro worked slowly and carefully with his fingers even as he held on,novel
that's a good way to do it. i'm sure he's used to it.,chit-chat
one of the links of the chain he found was imperfect had cracked and presented on one side a jagged edge,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of that before. did you find it?,chit-chat
hope sang in his breast once more,novel
"i'm sure he did. he's a pretty good singer, and he has a great sense of humor.",chit-chat
but he knew that he would have to work carefully,novel
"that's true, but it's hard when you have to work so hard to get where you want to go.",chit-chat
he did not dare release his hold entirely for a sudden dip of the bow and the quick wash of the water would be enough to sweep him from the chain,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he didn't get hurt too badly.,chit-chat
but he sawed back and forth as well as he could pulling the rope across the rough edge of the chain link,novel
that's what i was thinking. i'm glad he was able to pull the chain across the rough edge of the chain link.,chit-chat
he glanced ahead,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm not sure i could do that.,chit-chat
the ships were not far apart now and the schooner swung a bit to starboard so as to bear down upon the pirate craft from a more advantageous angle,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope the schooner was able to recover quickly.,chit-chat
zorro worked frantically and after a time he felt the rope give,novel
i love zorro. he's such a great heel. he was the first heel to win the ic title.,chit-chat
his wrists were raw and paining,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's doing better now. what happened to him?,chit-chat
his leg was bleeding already,novel
"oh no, that's terrible. i'm so sorry to hear that. what happened?",chit-chat
there were pains in his head and his vision was imperfect but hope sang within him once more,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope he's doing better now. what happened to him?,chit-chat
he sawed and sawed and once more he glanced ahead,novel
that's a good way to look at it. what did he do to deserve that?,chit-chat
it would not be long now before the ships clashed,novel
that's true. it's been a while since i've been on a ship.,chit-chat
he wanted to be up on the deck normal breath in his nostrils and the sword of zorro in his hand to aid his friends to fight his way to the deck of the pirate craft and to the _se単oritas_ side,novel
"wow, that sounds like a lot of fun. did you get to meet any of your friends?",chit-chat
the rope gave again,novel
what did the rope give again? i'm not sure what you're talking about.,chit-chat
se単or zorro was forced to rest for a moment leaning back on the chain,novel
se単or zorro was forced to rest for a moment leaning back on the chain.,chit-chat
a wave swept him to one side and he thought for an instant that he was gone,novel
that must have been scary. did you get out of the car and get back in the car?,chit-chat
but he regained his balance and continued his sawing,novel
that's what i was thinking. i'm glad he didn't get hurt.,chit-chat
and presently he knew that he was free,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he didn't.,chit-chat
the rope dangled from one wrist only,novel
"oh wow, that must have been scary. how did you manage to get the rope out?",chit-chat
he gave an exclamation of delight and thanks gripped the chain and turned over,novel
that's so nice of him. i'm glad he's doing well now.,chit-chat
he regarded his bleeding wrists hesitated a moment gathered breath and courage and commenced the perilous ascent of the chain,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad he was brave enough to do something like that.,chit-chat
it was a painful and difficult task,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you have to do to get it done?,chit-chat
se単or zorro set his teeth into his lower lip and struggled upward foot by foot,novel
"se単or zorro is an american singer, songwriter, and actor. what did he do?",chit-chat
the swinging chain slippery from the sea threatened to pitch him back into the water,novel
"wow, that's scary. i hope he's ok. i've never been in a situation like that before.",chit-chat
every few feet he was obliged to stop to gasp for breath and close his eyes for a moment because the pain in his wrists and leg made him weak with nausea,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope he's better now. what happened to him?,chit-chat
he came within a short distance of the vessel slipped back and forced his way upward again,novel
that's pretty cool. did you find out who did it or was it just a coincidence?,chit-chat
and finally he grasped with one hand the chain port and held on,novel
that's what i was thinking. i'm glad he didn't get hurt.,chit-chat
his hope had increased now,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find peace with him.,chit-chat
nothing would make him loose his hold he told himself,novel
that's what i was thinking. i don't know what to do with myself.,chit-chat
a moment he rested then forced his way upward again,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he's doing well.,chit-chat
the schooner was very close to the pirate ship now,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get back on your feet soon.,chit-chat
on the deck above him se単or zorro could hear don audre ruiz shrieking instructions to the _caballeros_ and the captain shouting to his crew,novel
se単or zorro could hear don audre ruiz shrieking instructions to the caballeros_ and the captain shouting to his crew,chit-chat
he managed to get up to the butt of the bowsprit and there safe from the sea he rested for a moment again,novel
that's awesome! i'm glad he was able to get back on his feet.,chit-chat
the two ships would crash together in a minute or so he saw,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never been on a ship before. what happened?,chit-chat
he raised his head weakly and took a deep breath and then struggled to his feet ready to spring down to the deck,novel
oh no! i hope he's okay. i'm sure he'll be fine.,chit-chat
his hand went down to whip the sword of zorro from its scabbard,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never heard of zorro. what's his name?,chit-chat
the schooner yawed suddenly as her helmsman fought to get a position of advantage,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never seen a schooner yawed before.,chit-chat
the big jib swung back whipped by the angry wind,novel

sanchez crossed himself quickly and the face of barbados turned white,novel

the schooner sailed on and came against the pirate ship with a crash,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never heard of a schooner sailing on a pirate ship.,chit-chat
but here was a battle unlike the usual one when honest men met pirates,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do to get away from the pirates?,chit-chat
as a usual thing the pirates could be expected to board and slay without mercy to loot and then either to destroy the illfated vessel or take it away a prize,novel
"that's a good way to look at it, but i'm not sure i'd want to do that.",chit-chat
and the honest men could be expected only to offer what defense they could,novel
that's a good point. i think it's important to be honest about what you're doing.,chit-chat
but here was a case where the honest men were more than willing to carry the fight to the pirates,novel
i'm not sure what you're talking about. did you mean to say that the honest men were more than willing to carry the fight to the pirates?,chit-chat

"i've never been to barbados, but i'm familiar with diego beloved barbados. have you ever been?",chit-chat
throughout the day he gave his attention to the sailing of the ship but he could not shake off the schooner which followed,novel
that must have been quite an experience. i'm sure he was very proud of himself.,chit-chat
then came the night and once more barbados cursed the bright moon,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're having a good day. do you have any plans for the weekend?,chit-chat
for though his craft showed no lights yet could she be seen from the schooner,novel

back and forth barbados sailed but always failing to shake off the other ship,novel

and when there came the dark hour before dawn he changed his course abruptly and ran before the breeze,novel

but when the dawn came there was the schooner a greater distance away but still in sight,novel

and so barbados put off to sea again for he wished if it were possible to go to the land rendezvous without drawing his foes there,novel

if the men of the schooner dared follow him to land they would be annihilated he promised,novel
that's really sweet of him. i'm sure he's a great person.,chit-chat

but in the next instant she told herself that it could not be,novel
"that's a good way to look at it, but it's not always true.",chit-chat
zorro had walked the plank with a weight fastened to his wrists,novel
"wow, that's impressive! did you have a good time walking the planks, or was it just a walk in the park?",chit-chat

"wow, that's pretty crazy. did you report it to the police or did they find out who it was?",chit-chat
she threw aside the momentary hope and crept toward the woman inez again,novel
that's not good. what did she do to make you think she was going to do that?,chit-chat
if the fight was going against the _caballeros_ if the pirates were to be victors she had scant time,novel

but perhaps i shall be more soon what mean you the woman gasped,novel
"i'm not sure what you mean by that, but i don't understand what you're trying to say.",chit-chat
perhaps it might have been in my mind that it would be better to have a real man than wed a gentleman of noble blood,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure i'd want to be married to a gentleman of noble blood.,chit-chat
is it not peculiar that barbados took me the night before my wedding ha,novel
"oh no, i'm sorry to hear that. how long did it take you to get to barbados?",chit-chat

there is no escape,novel
that's true. it's hard to escape when you're in a bad place.,chit-chat
so i may as well make the best of it,novel
that's good to hear. i'm sure you'll have a great time.,chit-chat
and since i am to be the woman of the pirate chief i must be loyal to him,novel
that's awesome! i'm sure he's proud of you for doing what you love.,chit-chat
if things must be so is it strange that i hope he gets much ransom and loot by the devils of hades the woman swore,novel
i don't think it's strange at all. i'm sure he'll be fine.,chit-chat
if i thought this to be truth can you not see that it is the _se単orita_ queried,novel
"no, i can't see what you are talking about. are you talking about something else?",chit-chat
captain ram坦n may have dealings with barbados but it does not follow that captain ram坦n is to have me,novel

"i know, i was so shocked. i was like, what are you talking about?!",chit-chat
so you would take my place the woman cried,novel
i don't know if i could do that. i'm not a good person.,chit-chat
the _se単orita_ recoiled as the other approached and held up one of her hands,novel
i've never heard of the se単orita_ before. what is it?,chit-chat
i have no desire to take your place she declared,novel
"i don't either, but i'm not sure if she's going to let me.",chit-chat
but since i can not help myself what else is there to do i could kill you with my bare hands and then barbados would kill you in turn and go find himself another woman ha,novel
i'm not sure i could do that. i'd have to find another woman first.,chit-chat
i could kill him you could not the _se単orita_ said,novel
i'm not sure what you're talking about. what did i say that you couldn't kill him?,chit-chat
the woman inez was quiet for a moment and then you are righti could not she replied,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did she say? did you say anything to her?,chit-chat
there is a way and how wench help me to escape the _se単orita_ said,novel

and you can in the meantime win back his love again ha,novel
"that's what i'm trying to do, but i don't know how to do it.",chit-chat
if i aid you to escape he will kill me make it appear that i escaped myself the _se単orita_ replied,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. do you think you'll be able to escape?,chit-chat
you are strong,novel
"thank you, i appreciate that. i'm trying to get better at it, but it's hard.",chit-chat
you can tear out that window until it is large enough for me to get through,novel
that's what i'm going to do. i can't wait to see what it looks like.,chit-chat
let him think that there was some tool in the storeroom and that i did the work ha,novel
"haha, that's a good way to look at it. what did you do?",chit-chat
if i thought you were speaking truth very well said the _se単orita_,novel
thank you! i'm glad you like it. what's your favorite kind of food?,chit-chat
wait and see whether it is the truth the woman hesitated searching the _se単oritas_ face with her keen glance,novel
that's a good idea. i'm not sure if it's true or not.,chit-chat
then she grunted and hurried into the other room while lolita pulido waited in fear and trembling wondering what was to come now,novel
"oh my god, that's so funny. i'm laughing so hard right now.",chit-chat
had the woman gone to tell barbados the story,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by barbados the story. are you referring to something else?,chit-chat
but presently inez returned and she carried a peculiar strip of iron with one sharp end a bit of wreckage perhaps from some illfated ship,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of that before. do you have a source?,chit-chat
watch you at the door on the inside she commanded,novel
i'm not sure what you mean. are you talking about the dog or the cat?,chit-chat
do not go into the other room,novel
i don't know if i want to go into the other room. i'm not sure what to do.,chit-chat
they are still fighting and perhaps there will be time the _se単orita_ hurried across to the door hope singing in her heart again,novel
that's a good idea. i'm sure she'll be happy to hear that.,chit-chat
there she watched and listened to the din of battle,novel
i love the din of battle. it's one of my favorite shows. what's your favorite episode?,chit-chat
all would be well if she could escape in the confusion and get away from the camp,novel
that's what i'm worried about. i don't know what to do.,chit-chat
she could reach el camino real and make her way along it,novel
that's a good idea. i'm not sure she's ready for that yet.,chit-chat
if she could reach san diego de alc叩la she would find friends,novel
have you ever been to san diego de alc叩la? it's a great city.,chit-chat
she turned and looked at the woman,novel
that's a good thing. i'm glad she didn't do it again.,chit-chat
inez was tearing out the masonry and adobe around the window,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never been to adobe. what's it like?,chit-chat

"i don't know what that means, but i'm not sure what it means.",chit-chat
i am small and do not need a very large space it is done the woman replied,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're doing well in your life.,chit-chat
she hurried back to the middle of the room and the _se単orita_ turned to look,novel
"oh my god, i hate when that happens. what did she do to make you look?",chit-chat
the aperture was large enough she knew at a glance,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad she didn't get hurt.,chit-chat
she could crawl through jump to the ground go up the slope and reach the fringe of trees that she could see in the distance,novel
that's a good idea. i'll try that next time i go up the slope.,chit-chat
once more hope came to her,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get through it.,chit-chat
i must have some old clothesragged and dirty clothes she said,novel
i'm sure you have some old clothesragged and dirty clothes that she said.,chit-chat
i will leave some of these the woman did not reply but she hurried from the storeroom with a gleam of avarice in her eyes,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get them back.,chit-chat
she was more than willing to trade ragged garments for some of silk and satin,novel
"wow, that's a lot of money. i'm glad you were able to help her.",chit-chat
back she came after a time and the _se単orita_ pulled off her gown and put on the ragged one shuddering as she did so not because of the rags but because of the dirt,novel
"oh my god, that's so gross! i'm so sorry to hear that.",chit-chat
she streaked her face with dirt from the floor and washed her hands in it disarranged her hair and threw a ragged shawl over her head,novel
"oh my god, that's so gross! i'm so sorry to hear that.",chit-chat

she hurried to the window the woman before her,novel
i would have done the same thing if i was in that situation. it's so rude of them to do that.,chit-chat
but inez grasped her by an arm and held her back,novel
that's what i was thinking. i'm glad she didn't get hurt.,chit-chat
not that way the woman gasped,novel
"i know, right? i was so shocked that she didn't know what she was doing.",chit-chat
it is too late,novel
"i know, but i can't help it. it's been a long time.",chit-chat
that way is guarded the heart of the _se単orita_ sank again,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'll have to keep that in mind.,chit-chat
she scrambled to the top of the cask she had used before and peered out,novel
oh no! did you have to clean it up? i've had that happen to me before.,chit-chat
within sight there were half a dozen men guarding that side of the camp against a possible surprise,novel
"oh wow, that's a lot of men. how did they guard that side of the camp?",chit-chat
if she got through the window they would see her block her path up the slope and toward the trees and investigate,novel
"that's a good idea, i'll try that next time i'm there.",chit-chat
is there no way out the _se単orita_ cried in despair,novel
"i don't think so, but i'm not sure if it's a good thing or not.",chit-chat
there is only the front then let me out the front way,novel
that's a good one. it's always nice to have someone to talk to.,chit-chat

i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to work through it.,chit-chat

and if you are caught you must take all the blame,novel
"that's true, but it's hard not to when you know you're going to get caught.",chit-chat
barbados would kill me if he knew give me a dagger the _se単orita_ begged,novel

the _se単orita_ clutched it and hid it away in her bosom,novel

for another moment they faced each other,novel

she has been kept safe i see you are to claim her what else ha inez gasped,novel
"yes, she has been safe. i'm not sure what i want to do with her.",chit-chat

"wow, that's crazy. i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope she's okay.",chit-chat

more biting than the blade you wear at your side _se単or_,novel
i'm not sure what you're talking about. what do you mean by that?,chit-chat
why do you not show your true colors,novel
"i don't know, i guess it's because i'm not very good at it.",chit-chat
why not go out and fight with your friends the pirates and thieves and murderers against men of gentle blood captain ram坦n bowed in mockery,novel
i don't think i could do that. i'm afraid i'd get caught.,chit-chat
if you will be kind enough to glance through the open door _se単orita_ you will perceive that the fighting is at an end he replied,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you talking about the dog or the cat?,chit-chat

into the storeroom _se単orita_ captain ram坦n commanded when they were alone,novel
"have you ever been to the storeroom? i've never been, but i'd like to.",chit-chat

he thrust her before him into the storeroom and closed the door behind him,novel
"wow, that's pretty gross. i'm glad he didn't do it again.",chit-chat
he darted across to the window and looked out acting mysteriously,novel
oh no! what did you do? did you say anything to him or what did he do?,chit-chat
if you would rid me of your foul presence the _se単orita_ began,novel
"i don't know what that means, but i'm not sure what it means.",chit-chat
captain ram坦n whirled toward her,novel
"i'm not sure what that means, but it sounds interesting. are you a captain?",chit-chat
on the long hot ride from reina de los angeles which had taken him the better part of two days and during which he had not spared mounts he had thought out everything,novel
"wow, that sounds like a lot of fun. did you have a good time with him?",chit-chat
he was playing a sort of double game this captain ram坦n,novel
that's pretty cool. what game was he rambling about? did he win or lose?,chit-chat
he wished to reinstate himself in the good graces of better men he wanted to make the _se単orita_ believe that he had rendered her a great service and try to win her regard openly and he wished to aid his master the governor in acquiring credit in the southland where he had small credit now,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i've never heard of him before. what's his name?",chit-chat
he had heard on his way to the pirate camp that se単or zorro had walked the plank,novel
"wow, that must have been a long walk. did you get to see se単or zorro?",chit-chat
he could take the helpless _se単orita_ now for his own but if he did that he would have to become a renegade forever live like an outcast,novel
i don't think he would be able to do that. i think he'd have to go to prison.,chit-chat
and captain ram坦n loved his uniform and wealth and power,novel
i'm sure he did. it's a shame that he didn't live up to the hype.,chit-chat
so why not play the pirates and honest men against each other and make a double winning,novel
i don't think i could do that. i'm not very good at sports.,chit-chat
he had had ample time to think it out,novel
that's what i'm thinking. i don't know what to do now.,chit-chat
and so as he faced the _se単oritas_ scorn he pretended surprise that she did not understand,novel
i don't think i've ever seen a se単oritasan before.,chit-chat
foul presence _se単orita_ he said,novel
i've never heard of foul presence before. i'll have to look into it.,chit-chat

"oh no, i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay.",chit-chat

i have followed swiftly to rescue you,novel
thank you so much! i really appreciate it. i'm so glad you followed me.,chit-chat
they think that i am a friend,novel
why do they think you are a friend? is it because you don't like them?,chit-chat
but now assured of your safety i can act speedily,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i think i'm going to do that.,chit-chat
let them continue thinking for the time being that i accept you as a prize,novel
that's what i'm trying to do. i just don't know what to do with myself.,chit-chat
i shall ride away to san diego de alc叩la which is but a few miles fetch the troopers from there rescue you release the _caballeros_ now held as prisoners and wipe out this pirate brood but why she began,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. i'm sure you'll have a great time.,chit-chat
it was the only way _se単orita_,novel
i've never heard of se単oritaos before. what is it about?,chit-chat
the soldiers are few and the pirates have been able to strike the coast where there were no troopers handy,novel
that's good to hear. it's always good to be prepared for the worst.,chit-chat
it is a trap that we have arranged for them,novel
what did you do to get them to do something that they didn't want to do?,chit-chat
perhaps it may not seem a gentle thing to dobut one can not be gentle with pirates i wish that i could believe you she said,novel
i don't think it's a gentle thing to do. i think she's just trying to make me feel better about myself.,chit-chat
believe me _se単orita_,novel
i've never heard of you before. what do you do for a living? do you have any hobbies?,chit-chat
i love you so much i am betrothed she said simply,novel

but i have grave news for you,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope it's something you're looking forward to.,chit-chat
i have been told that don diego vega is no more that these beasts forced him as se単or zorro to walk the plank i was there she said her eyes filling with tears,novel
"wow, that's so sad. i'm glad don diego is doing better now.",chit-chat
i saw it,novel
what did you see? i can't wait to see what it's like to see it in person.,chit-chat
nevertheless i am betrothed to him _se単or_ now and forever in life and in death that is because your grief is new the captain said,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
you are young _se単orita_ you have a life to live,novel
"i have a life to live, but i don't have a lot of time for it.",chit-chat
if you would live it with me _se単or_ she warned,novel

i can understand why you dislike me a bit he said,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did he say to you that made you dislike him?,chit-chat
perhaps in the past i did some things that a gentleman should not do,novel

but it was because of my great love for you because i was afraid of losing you _se単or_ let us talk of other things if we must talk the _se単orita_ begged,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
do you not realize _se単orita_ that if i wish it you are in my power now you are showing your true colors she said,novel

and if i succeed can not you look upon me with some favor if i have misjudged you _se単or_ i am indeed sorry she replied,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm sure you'll be fine.,chit-chat
but it is useless to talk of such things,novel
"that's true, but i think it's important to talk to people about it.",chit-chat
my heart is with don diego vega in life and in death perhaps in the future there can be no hope _se単or_ captain ram坦ns face flushed and his eyes blazed for an instant,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i don't know who don diego vega is.,chit-chat
but he still had his game to play the manysided game that he hoped would result in great fortune,novel
"that's true, but it's hard to believe that he didn't win.",chit-chat
if you could only believe me he said,novel
what did he say? i've never heard of that before. what was he saying?,chit-chat

and ill return to you before i ride for san diego de alc叩la if there are more plans you should know captain ram坦n opened the door bowed low as she passed through it and looked after her with the corners of his lips curled,novel
"i've never been to san diego, but i'd love to go on a ride with you.",chit-chat

chapter xx,novel
"i've been reading a lot of manga lately, it's a great way to get back into the story.",chit-chat
the unexpected,novel
have you ever been in a situation where you were expected to be expected to do something unexpected?,chit-chat
captain ram坦n bade the woman guard the _se単orita_ well and then hurried from the adobe building,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never seen the adobe building before. what's the name of the building?,chit-chat
just in front of it he stopped to look over the scene,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he didn't get hurt.,chit-chat
dead men were scattered on the ground at a distance,novel
that's terrible. i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're ok.,chit-chat
there were more dead men around the huts where the crew of the trading schooner had made their last stand,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of a trading schooner before. what was their name?,chit-chat
the wounded were shrieking and groaning and some of the pirates were giving them a rough surgery,novel
that's terrible. i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay.,chit-chat
others were hurrying the _caballero_ prisoners toward another adobe building where they were to be kept,novel
"wow, that's crazy. i'm glad they were able to get away with it.",chit-chat
women and children ran beside them shrieking insults hurling small stones,novel
that's so sad. i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're ok.,chit-chat
but the _caballeros_ held their heads proudly and laughed and jested with one another,novel
the caballeros_ has been around for a long time. they have been around since the late 19th century.,chit-chat
captain ram坦n darted to the end of the building so he would not be seen by the prisoners,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you were able to get out of the building.,chit-chat
it was not in his mind to be suspected at the outset,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad you didn't get caught.,chit-chat
the game he was playing was one of hazard and he knew that the slightest mistake would be disastrous,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's doing better next season. i've been watching him for a while now.,chit-chat
he had planned with barbados to conduct the raid and thereby had gained the pirate chiefs confidence,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never been to barbados. what's the raid about?,chit-chat
and now he had further plans,novel
that's good to hear. i'm glad he was able to find a way to make it work.,chit-chat
he would tell barbados that he would draw to the camp the troopers at san diego de alc叩la,novel
i've never been to san diego de alc叩la. what is it like there?,chit-chat
barbados and his men could ambush them and wipe them out,novel
"i don't know much about barbados, but i do know that it is a sovereign island nation.",chit-chat
then the pirates could cross the hills and raid and loot rich san diego de alc叩la,novel
i would love to see that. it would be so cool to see how they would react.,chit-chat
but the captain intended no such thing in reality,novel
that's what i was thinking. i'm glad he didn't do it.,chit-chat
knowing how barbados would prepare the ambush he would lead the troopers in such a manner that the pirates would be wiped out to a man,novel
"i'm not familiar with barbados, but i do know that the troopers have been around for a long time.",chit-chat
then the _caballeros_ and the _se単orita_ could be rescued and captain ram坦n would pose as their heroic rescuer,novel
that's a great idea! i'd love to see that. what would you like to see?,chit-chat
he hoped in this manner to regain the good will of the _caballeros_ and a better standing with them and to earn the gratitude of the _se単orita_ also,novel
that's a great way to look at it. i'm glad he did that.,chit-chat
word of the exploit would run up and down el camino real,novel
i don't think i've ever heard of that before. what's it about?,chit-chat
men whose hands were now raised against the licentious and unscrupulous governor would think better of him because the pirates had been wiped out,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a fan of the pirates.",chit-chat
the governor in turn would be grateful to captain ram坦n,novel
the governor in turn would be grateful to captain ram坦n. he's a great governor.,chit-chat
and he would order don carlos pulido who was not dead of his wound to give the hand of his daughter lolita to captain ram坦n,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i've never heard of don carlos pulido.",chit-chat
don carlos scarce could refuse without endangering his fortunes further,novel
i'm not familiar with don carlos scarce. what's his name? is he a comedian?,chit-chat
it was a pretty plot the plot of a master rogue willing to sell friends and foes alike to advance his own interests,novel
that sounds like a very interesting plot. what did you end up doing to advance your own interests?,chit-chat
captain ram坦n grinned as he thought of it and twirled his mustache and marched around the corner of the building and across the open space toward where barbados was standing and shouting orders concerning the disposition of the corpses,novel
"hello, captain ram坦n. how are you doing today? i just got back from barbados.",chit-chat
and suddenly the captain found himself confronted by a man and looked up quickly to see the burning eyes of old fray felipe fastened upon his face,novel
"oh my god, that's so funny! i'm laughing so hard right now.",chit-chat
what does an officer of the governor in such a place unless he be a prisoner of war fray felipe demanded,novel
i don't know. i'm not sure what he does in such a place.,chit-chat
captain ram坦n bowed before him,novel
i've never heard of a ramoned bowed before. are you a fan of him?,chit-chat
perhaps there are things that you do not understand _fray_ he replied,novel
i don't think so. i'm not sure what he's talking about.,chit-chat
and perhaps _commandante_ there are things that i do understand fray felipe said,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you saying you don't understand what he's saying?,chit-chat
perhaps years of service in behalf of humanity have taught me to read a mans face and mind,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad to hear that.,chit-chat
rogue brute traitor you are a _fray_ and wear a gown that should be respected but do not tempt me too far captain ram坦n said angrily,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
say your prayers and leave mens work to men the captain bowed again walked around the _fray_ and hurried to the side of barbados,novel
i love barbados. it's my favorite place in the world to visit. have you been there before?,chit-chat
ha the pirate cried,novel

if se単or zorro were here but he is not here ram坦n cried laughing and leering at her,novel
i've never heard of se単or zorro. what's his name?,chit-chat
and so again he started toward her and her hand darted to her bosom to snatch out the dagger the woman inez had given her earlier,novel

as captain ram坦n recoiled and the _se単orita_ gave a little cry of fright the intruders head flew up,novel

over the crest of the slope the animal beneath him plunged down into a ravine and galloped along it,novel
"wow, that must have been scary. what happened to the animal? did he get hurt?",chit-chat
se単or zorro sheathed his sword and held on to the horses mane,novel

he bent low to avoid tree branches that promised to sweep him from the animals back,novel
that's not good. i'm sorry to hear that. what did he do?,chit-chat
_dios_ he muttered,novel
i don't think i've ever heard of that before. what does it mean?,chit-chat
this is as bad as the battle some distance the frightened horse traveled and then he made a great circle and returned toward the pirate camp,novel
oh no! that's terrible! i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay.,chit-chat
but se単or zorro had no wish to return there too soon lest he be captured in the vicinity,novel
"yes, se単or zorro had no wish to return there too soon lest he be captured in the vicinity.",chit-chat
and so he waited until the horse negotiating a slippery incline slackened pace somewhat and slipped easily from the animals back,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad he didn't get hurt too bad.,chit-chat
the horse plunged on,novel
have you ever ridden a horse? it's one of the most popular recreational animals in the world.,chit-chat
se単or zorro picked himself up observed his scratches and made a futile effort to brush his clothing,novel
"hey se単or, how are you doing today? i just got back from walking my dog.",chit-chat
then he walked to the crest of the slope and looked down toward the sea,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad he didn't get hurt too bad.,chit-chat
he was quite a way from the camp but he could see it in the distance see the dead and wounded on the ground and a crowd of the pirates with their women and children in front of the adobe building that was being used as a prison,novel
"wow, that's horrible. i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's ok.",chit-chat
se単or zorro sat down to rest and watch,novel

he knew that he was confronted by a dire emergency and a tremendous task but he refused to admit it to himself,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to work through it.,chit-chat
the _se単orita_ was down there and she was to be rescued,novel
that's awesome! i'm glad you were able to rescue her. what did she do?,chit-chat
and don audre ruiz and the _caballeros_ were there to be rescued also,novel
i've never heard of don audre ruiz. what's he up to these days?,chit-chat
se単or zorro after a breathing spell got up and walked slowly along the crest of the slope among the stunted and windtwisted trees making certain that he could not be observed from the camp,novel
"wow, se単or zorro, that's a name i haven't heard in a long time.",chit-chat
he came a distance nearer and watched for a time again,novel
that's nice of him. what did he do to make you think it was him?,chit-chat
and he saw captain ram坦n,novel
i've never heard of that. what's it like to be captain ramoned?,chit-chat
if it had been in the mind of se単or zorro to await the night before descending into the camp again that idea left his mind now,novel
i've never heard of se単or zorro. what's his name?,chit-chat
he hurried forward as speedily as possible stopping now and then to listen for fear some of the pirates may have been sent to search for him,novel
"that's a good way to look at it, but i don't think so.",chit-chat
he did not know could not think how he was to enter the camp in the broad light of day without escaping discovery,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he was able to escape.,chit-chat
and he could do little singlehanded against the victorious pirate crew,novel
i don't know if i could do that. i'm not very good at fighting.,chit-chat
yet the plight of the little _se単orita_ called to him for action and he knew that something should be done at once,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to take care of him.,chit-chat
and suddenly he stopped for he had smelled smoke,novel
oh no! i hope he didn't get hurt. i've had that happen to me before.,chit-chat
almost silently he crept forward through the brush and came to a small clearing,novel
that's awesome! what did you do? did you get out of the car and get back in the car?,chit-chat
there he saw a hut from the chimney of which smoke was issuing,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad he didn't have to go through that.,chit-chat
se単or zorro circled the hut but saw no human being,novel
se単or zorro was one of my favorite characters growing up. he was such an interesting character.,chit-chat
he went to the crest of the slope again and saw a woman struggling down it toward the pirates campa woman bent and old,novel
"wow, that must have been a scary experience. did you find out who she was or what she was doing?",chit-chat
se単or zorro guessed then that this was the hut of some aged lawbreaker no longer active in piracy,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i've never been to piracy, but i'd love to go one day.",chit-chat
perhaps the ancient one was down in the camp now that the fighting was at an end and his ancient woman was following to see the excitement,novel
"that's a good theory, but i'm not sure if it's true.",chit-chat
se単or zorro approached the hut carefully crept around the corner of it and peered in at the door to find the place empty,novel
"hello, se単or zorro. how are you doing today? i hope you are okay.",chit-chat
he rushed inside and sought frantically for what he desired,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i hope he didn't get hurt.,chit-chat
there came a chuckle of delight as he found it,novel
that's great! i'm glad he found it. what did he do with it?,chit-chat
what he desired and found was nothing more than a ragged skirt and a wide dirty shawl,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad you found it. what did you do with it?,chit-chat
se単or zorro put them on quickly bent his shoulders and hobbled back among the trees and brush,novel
i have never heard of se単or zorro. what does he do for a living?,chit-chat
it was a disguise that would serve for the time being,novel
that's a good way of looking at it. what did you do to deserve it?,chit-chat
beneath the skirt was the sword of zorro ready to be whipped from its scabbard,novel
i love zorro. he's my favorite character in the series. what's your favorite character?,chit-chat
se単or zorro felt confident as long as the blade was at his side,novel
se単or zorro is one of my favorites. he is such a great actor.,chit-chat
he left the fringe of trees at some distance from the hut and made his way down the slope,novel
"wow, that's pretty impressive. did he get hurt at all? did he die?",chit-chat
as he came nearer the camp he was doubly cautious,novel
that's a good thing to do. i'm glad he didn't get hurt.,chit-chat
the horses had lost some of the fright and were grazing,novel
"oh no, that's terrible! i'm so sorry to hear that. what happened?",chit-chat
the pirates for the greater part were gathered around the adobe building where the _caballeros_ were being held prisoners,novel
"wow, that's crazy. i've never heard of that before. what happened?",chit-chat
the women and children were there too only some of them were still scattered around the camp looking at the dead and wounded,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. it's so sad that people have to go through that.,chit-chat
se単or zorro perceived that he had arrived at an opportune time,novel
what did se単or zorro do to get there at such an opportune time?,chit-chat
nobody would give any attention to a woman stumbling along toward the scene of excitement,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure i could do that. i don't think i could.,chit-chat
the pirates undoubtedly imagined that zorro had ridden far away perhaps to san diego de alc叩la for help,novel
i have never been to san diego de alc叩la. what is it like there?,chit-chat
he approached nearer,novel
that's a good thing to do. i'm glad he didn't approach me.,chit-chat
there were two large adobe buildings and he supposed that the _se単orita_ was held prisoner in one of them but he did not know which,novel
"wow, that's crazy. i'm glad he didn't know which one.",chit-chat
then he stopped suddenly and bent his shoulders more,novel
that's what happens when you don't pay attention to what you're doing.,chit-chat
for he saw captain ram坦n talking to barbados saw the _commandante_ turn and leave the pirate chief and hurry into the nearest adobe building,novel
"that's pretty cool. i've never been to barbados, but i'd like to go one day.",chit-chat
se単or zorro guessed that the _se単orita_ was there,novel
i've never heard of se単or zorro. what's his name?,chit-chat
he hobbled forward again alert to keep a certain distance from any of the pirates or women for he realized that they knew one another well,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he didn't get hurt.,chit-chat
he reached the corner of the building and began to circle it listening intently for the voice he hoped to hear,novel
what was the voice he wanted to hear? i'm sure he didn't want to hear it.,chit-chat
he heard it,novel
that's what i was thinking. i'm glad he didn't say anything.,chit-chat
pretending to be picking up something from the ground se単or zorro bent against the wall and listened,novel
have you ever pretended to be picking something up from the ground se単or zorro?,chit-chat
he heard captain ram坦ns statements heard the _se単orita_ reply listened with a grim expression on his face while the _commandante_ begged for an embrace,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. what are you going to do with the rest of the day?,chit-chat
it would be perilous to enter that building now se単or zorro knew,novel
i don't think se単or zorro would have been able to do that.,chit-chat
ram坦n would call the pirates but perhaps he could be silenced first,novel
that's a good idea. i'll have to think about that. thanks for the idea!,chit-chat
however there could be no hesitation,novel
"that's true, but i'm not sure if it's worth the risk.",chit-chat
the _se単orita_ was there being affronted and was to be spared insult,novel
i've never heard of that one. what was it about? i'm not familiar with it.,chit-chat
se単or zorro saw the window and guessed that he could manage to struggle through it,novel
se単or zorro is such a great character. he's one of my favorite characters.,chit-chat
he raised his head and glanced inside,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he didn't get hurt.,chit-chat
he saw the _se単orita_ recoiling the _commandante_ approaching her,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never seen a se単oritaian before.,chit-chat
se単or zorro hesitated no longer,novel
"se単or zorro is an american singer, songwriter, and actor. have you heard of him?",chit-chat
he sprang up and scrambled through the window,novel
oh no! what did he do? did you have to get out of the house or what?,chit-chat
he tore at the womans clothing that clung to him got free of it and whipped out the sword of zorro,novel
"wow, that's impressive. i'm glad he didn't do that to anyone else.",chit-chat
he pressed the _se単orita_ to one side out of harms way and confronted his enemy,novel
"wow, that's pretty intense. i hope he didn't get hurt too badly.",chit-chat
his open hand cracked against captain ram坦ns head,novel
"oh wow, that's interesting. i've never heard of rambo's head before.",chit-chat
and then he stepped back on guard giving the renegade officer his chance though he little deserved it,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a renegade officer.",chit-chat
you are alive the _se単orita_ gasped,novel
"i'm not sure what that means, but thank you! i've never heard of it before.",chit-chat
ha,novel
"ha ha ha, ha ha... ha ha!!! haha! ha!",chit-chat
very much alive se単or zorro replied,novel

i do that all the time. i think it's because i'm so pretty.,chit-chat
this is not going to be pleasant for a dainty ladys eyes to watch illustration the further adventures of zorro part v chapter xxii,novel
"oh no, i'm sorry to hear that. what's wrong with your eyes?",chit-chat
a price to be paid,novel
what do you mean by a price to be paid? i'm not sure what you mean.,chit-chat
the face of captain ram坦n turned livid as he struggled to get his sword from its scabbard,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you were able to get the sword back.,chit-chat
there was a look of fear in his countenance too,novel
i don't think i've ever been afraid of anything in my life. i'm glad he's doing well.,chit-chat
zorro he cried,novel
i love zorro! he's my favorite character. what's your favorite character?,chit-chat
se単or zorro eh _s鱈_ zorro came the answer,novel
"i've never heard of zorro, but i know he's a spanish singer.",chit-chat
there is not water enough in all the sea to drown me while there remains something to be avenged,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. do you think you'll be able to escape?,chit-chat
we have crossed blades before _se単or_ and i have marked you,novel
i've never heard of that before. what was the name of the person you marked?,chit-chat
but this time shall be the last,novel
i hope so. it's been a long time since i've been in a relationship.,chit-chat
a fatal wound this time _capitan_,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay. are you okay?,chit-chat
it is an honor that i do not cut you down without giving you the chance to defend yourself captain ram坦n finally had his sword out and now he was on guard,novel
that's awesome! i'm glad he's on guard now. it's always good to be on guard.,chit-chat
but he could not forget that once before in his life he had crossed blades with se単or zorro and zorro had played with him as a cat plays with a mouse and finally had left him for dead after marking him on the forehead,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. i've never heard of zorro before.",chit-chat
and so the captain grew desperately afraid feeling that he had small chance against the better sword play of the other,novel
i don't think i've ever seen a better sword play than when i was a kid.,chit-chat
he sprang back toward the door to the front room but found se単or zorro before him blocking the way,novel
that's pretty cool. did you find out who he was or what he was up to?,chit-chat
are you a coward and would run zorro taunted,novel
"i don't think so, but i'm not sure what zorro taunt is.",chit-chat

se単or zorros face assumed an expression of grim determination and he advanced swiftly,novel
se単or zorros face assumed an expression of grim determination and he advanced * * swiftly * *,chit-chat
but captain ram坦n had found another method of protection for the time being,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think of that. i'll have to look into that.,chit-chat
he sprang back beside the _se単orita_ grasped her roughly and held her before him shielding his body with hers,novel
"wow, that's pretty intense. i'm glad he didn't hurt her.",chit-chat

for once in your life _se単or_ can you not show yourself a _caballero_ save him and let him claim you ram坦n asked,novel
that's a good idea. i'm going to try that next time i see him.,chit-chat
you are asking far too much is there no other way none he replied,novel
that's what i'm thinking. i don't know what to do now.,chit-chat
there are certain things that you must dobe my wife and i will save se単or zorro by fetching the troopers from san diego de alc叩la,novel
that's very kind of you to do. i'm sure she appreciates that.,chit-chat
and afterward you must say that i did but trick the pirates and that you wed me in gratitude for saving you from them such a falsehood would not come easily from my lips _se単or_ she said,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're feeling better now. what did you do?,chit-chat
and how can i trust you,novel
i don't know... i'm not sure what to do with myself.,chit-chat
how do i know that you would fetch the troopers i am not afraid to make the bargain he told her,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm not sure if i could do that.,chit-chat
you need not wed me until after the pirates are defeated and the _caballeros_ are released,novel
i don't think i've ever heard of the caballeros_ before. what's it about?,chit-chat
that is fair enough for both is it not,novel
"it is, but i'm not sure if i should be upset about it or not.",chit-chat
but how on the other hand may i be assured that you will not forget your part of the bargain once i have done my share _se単or_ she cried her face flaming,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i've had that happen to me before too.,chit-chat
would a daughter of the pulidos break her given word then you give it he asked,novel
"i don't think so, but i'm not sure if it would be a good idea.",chit-chat
not yet she replied firmly,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you referring to the fact that she doesn't have a job?,chit-chat
there are to be certain stipulations _se単or_ and they he questioned,novel
i don't think i've ever had a stipulate that i couldn't sleep.,chit-chat
i must see se単or zorro alone and speak to him and explain just what i intend to do,novel
se単or zorro? i've never heard of him. what's his name?,chit-chat
i would tell him the truththat you will save him and the others if i wed you,novel
that's a good idea. i'm not sure if i can do that though.,chit-chat
i would not have him think that my heart is one that can change so easily ha,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure i'd be able to do that.,chit-chat
after that you would have to save him against his will,novel
"that's what i'm thinking, but i don't know what to do.",chit-chat
he would not accept the sacrifice then will i save him despite himself she declared,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. do you think you'll be able to save him?,chit-chat
and you need not fear for the future in such case _se単or_,novel
"i don't fear for the future, but i do worry about what i'm going to do in the future.",chit-chat
once we were wed se単or zorro would not raise his hand against you if i asked him not to do so perhaps it may be arranged captain ram坦n said,novel
se単or zorro? that's a name i haven't heard in a long time.,chit-chat
he was plotting more even as he spoke,novel
what did he say? i don't think i've ever heard of that before.,chit-chat
he did not see how he could lose in this game,novel
that's too bad. i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he learned his lesson.,chit-chat
if he fetched the troopers and the pirates were wiped out and the _caballeros_ saved the _se単orita_ would keep her word if she had given it,novel
i don't think she would have given it to him if he didn't do it.,chit-chat
men might despise him for taking advantage of a situation yet would he be safe,novel
i don't think he would be safe. i'm not sure what to do.,chit-chat
and perhaps for a small sum he could have this se単or zorro killed yet,novel
that's what i was thinking. i'm not sure what to do with him.,chit-chat
and if the pirates through some fortune of war managed to be victorious over the troopers then captain ram坦n could do the other thingsimply seize the _se単orita_ give se単or zorro up to torture and remain a renegade perhaps even become a pirate chief himself in the future,novel
i'm not sure if i would want to be a pirate chief. i'd rather be a soldier.,chit-chat
i will speak to no other man _se単or_only zorro she said as he seemed to hesitate,novel
i will speak to no other man * se単or_only zorro * she said as he seemed to hesitate,chit-chat
i will not betray your doubledealing to the pirate crew for that would defeat all our ends and mean death for se単or zorro and the _caballeros_ and much worse for me,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what happened to se単or zorro and the caballeros_?,chit-chat
but i must speak to se単or zorro a moment before i give you my decision in the matter i will try to arrange it with barbados captain ram坦n replied,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you are able to get it sorted out.,chit-chat

"wow, that must have been exciting to see him. did he have a good time there?",chit-chat
the pirate chief it was easy to see had been drinking heavily of rich stolen wine,novel

among the pirates slain were some of barbadoss particular friends and he was trying to drown his sorrow at their untimely taking off,novel
that's so sad. i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're ok.,chit-chat
he turned as the _commandante_ approached and greeted him with a shout,novel

i would not want the taming of her,novel
"yeah, i don't think i could do that. i'm not sure i could handle it.",chit-chat
by my naked blade i would not attend me the captain commanded grasping the pirate chief by the arm,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you didn't get hurt too badly.,chit-chat
is it your intention to torture this se単or zorro your men have taken barbados cursed loudly breathed heavily and squinted his eyes until they were only two tiny slits,novel
"no, i'm not going to do that. i don't want to hurt anyone.",chit-chat
i shall make him squirm and squeal he declared loudly,novel
that sounds like a good way to make him angry. i hope he doesn't do that again.,chit-chat
and then i shall turn him into a proper ghost death is nothing to a man like that captain ram坦n told him,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to do something about it.,chit-chat

i don't think i'm acting the part of an ass barbados dare to say.,chit-chat
why work so hard to get the wench to agree to wed you when you can take her at your pleasure because it will hurt this se単or zorro a great deal more to know that she gives her consent the captain replied,novel
i'm not sure what you're trying to say. are you trying to tell me something i don't understand?,chit-chat
well taunt him about it and then ill ride for the soldiers,novel

but her back was toward the window and they could not see all,novel

"wow, that's really interesting. i've never heard of se単or zorro before.",chit-chat
his hands now would be free at any time he wished to drop the ends of the cords that bound his wrists,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he's doing better now.,chit-chat
he had a weapon hidden in the sash about his waist,novel
"oh, that's interesting. did you find out who it was or what it was?",chit-chat
given those minor advantages se単or zorro felt that he could disconcert his enemies again else fail to be zorro,novel
i don't think se単or is zorro. i think he's a bit of a clown.,chit-chat
but the expression in his face did not change as he walked slowly around the room and finally came to a stop before the window and glanced across the clearing and the beach toward the glistening water of the bay,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never been to the glistening water of the bay.,chit-chat
he looked like a man devoid of all hope expecting the worst,novel
that's a good way to put it. i can't wait to see what he does next.,chit-chat
not so very far away was a small hut before the one door of which two of the pirates sat on guard,novel
"oh wow, that must have been scary. did you have to get out of the hut?",chit-chat

that sounds like a lot of fun. i'd love to have a horse one day.,chit-chat
barbadoss lieutenant dismounted and allowed the animal to wander near the hut while he hurried in search of the pirate chief with some report,novel
that's pretty cool. what kind of animal did he wander near the hut with some report?,chit-chat
these things se単or zorro saw quickly and then he hurried back to the door that opened into the other room,novel
oh no! what did he do? did you have to get out of the other room?,chit-chat
it was barred and locked with a strong lock and zorro had no tools with which to open it,novel
that's pretty cool. did you find out who did it or did you just assume it was zorro?,chit-chat
he could not unfasten it and release his friends but he could hold speech with them,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think of that. i'm glad he was able to do that.,chit-chat
he made certain that nobody was near the window to overhear and then kicked against the door to attract the attention of the _caballeros_,novel
that's a good way to attract attention. what did you do to get the attention of the caballeros?,chit-chat
audre he called in a guarded voice,novel
i've never heard of audre before. i'll have to look it up.,chit-chat
there was silence for a moment and then he heard a whisper from the other side of the door,novel
"oh my god, that's so scary! what did he say to the other side of the door?",chit-chat

i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
it is a poor weapon but better than none,novel
that's what i'm thinking. i don't know what to do with it.,chit-chat
it would avail us nothing for me to let you out if i could for the pirates greatly outnumber us,novel
"i'm sorry to hear that. what do you do for a living, if you don't mind me asking?",chit-chat
but i can try to escape and ride to san diego de alc叩la for troopers good diego my friend i know not what may happen before i am able to return,novel
"i've never been to san diego, but i hear it's a great place to visit.",chit-chat

i've never heard of don audre. what's he up to these days?,chit-chat

the horse sanchez had been riding was now but a short distance from the adobe building,novel
"wow, that's a long distance. did you get to see the horse at all?",chit-chat
the two guards were squatted before the hut wherein the captured weapons had been stored drinking and talking,novel
"wow, that must have been a lot of work. how long did it take for the guards to get there?",chit-chat
other pirates were in the distance walking around stretched in the shade of the huts gambling shouting quarreling,novel
"i've never been to a casino, but i'd love to go one day.",chit-chat
se単or zorro knew well that it would profit nothing to get those weapons in the hut for the _caballeros_ could not be liberated quickly and so the element of surprise in an attack would be lost,novel
se単or zorro was a very smart man. he knew what he was doing.,chit-chat
moreover were they liberated and their swords in their hands they would only be cut down by the pirate crew after they had taken some toll,novel
"i don't think so, but i'm not sure. it's been a while since i've read the books.",chit-chat
se単or zorro wanted his own sword but did not know whether there would be time for him to get possession of it,novel
se単or zorro is such a cool character. he's one of my favorite characters.,chit-chat
he would not dare stop to attack the two guards for the other pirates would rush up and endanger his chance for escape,novel
he would not dare stop to attack the two guards for the other pirates would rush up and endanger his chance for escape,chit-chat

"that sounds like a lot of fun, but i'm not sure i could do it.",chit-chat
back to the door he hurried,novel
that's what i was thinking. i'm glad he didn't get hurt.,chit-chat
audre he called softly,novel
i have never heard of audre before. is it a song by the same name as audre?,chit-chat
_s鱈_ raise a din in there create a bedlam of a sort and twill help me vastly,novel
that's a good idea. i'm not sure i'd be able to do that.,chit-chat
pretend to be fighting among yourselves he did not have very long to wait,novel
that's a good idea. i'm sure he didn't want to get in trouble.,chit-chat
he could hear don audre ruiz whispering instructions to the other _caballeros_ and almost instantly they began shrieking at one another pounding on the heavy door making a bedlam of noise,novel
"wow, that must have been scary. i hope you were able to get out of the house.",chit-chat
se単or zorro hurried across to the outside window and called to the guards before the hut,novel
se単or zorro ran across to the outside window and called to the guards before the hut,chit-chat
come here he shouted,novel
i don't know what i'm going to do when i hear him say that.,chit-chat
the prisoners are fighting and slaying one another but they refused to leave their posts as se単or zorro had hoped they would do,novel
that's terrible. i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do to them?,chit-chat
instead they shrieked the news at barbados who was not far away and he ran toward the adobe building followed by sanchez and half a dozen of the men,novel
"wow, that's crazy. i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope he's okay.",chit-chat
they unbarred the door and burst in upon se単or zorro who stood back against the wall gazing at the door of the adjoining room as though trying to decide what was taking place inside,novel
"wow, that must have been scary. did you find out what was going on in the room?",chit-chat
from the other side of that door came shrieks and cries and the sounds of blows,novel
oh no! what happened to the other side of the door? did you call the police?,chit-chat
fiends of hell barbados swore,novel
have you ever heard of fiends of hell barbados swear? it's a british tv series.,chit-chat
they will slay one another and then there will be neither torture nor ransom,novel
i don't think they will do that. they've been doing it for a long time.,chit-chat
unfasten that door and stand ready to drive them back if they try to make an escape,novel
that's a good idea. i'll have to do that next time i see them.,chit-chat
and two of you guard that outside door also one glance he flung at se単or zorro to find him standing against the wall as if his attention were concentrated on the other room,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm not sure i could do that.,chit-chat
but as barbados turned toward the door again se単or zorro shifted along the wall for a distance of a few feet and glanced toward the door through which he would have to go to freedom,novel
se単or zorro... that's a name i haven't heard in a long time.,chit-chat
he waited until the other door was about to be thrown open until the pirates in the room had their attention centered there and then se単or zorro dropped the severed cords from his wrists wriggled his fingers for an instant to restore the circulation of blood and suddenly brought his hands around in front of him and tore the dagger from his sash where the little _se単orita_ had put it,novel
"wow, that's pretty intense. i'm glad he didn't get hurt.",chit-chat
forward he hurled himself just as the other door was opened,novel
oh no! that's terrible. i hope he's okay. what did he do?,chit-chat
he took the two men before him by surprise,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad he didn't have to do that.,chit-chat
one he hurled aside the other he was forced to wound slightly to get him out of the way,novel
that's so sad. i hope he's ok. what did he do to hurt you?,chit-chat
past them he dashed even as they shrieked the intelligence that he was escaping,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he was able to escape.,chit-chat
out into the open he darted and straight toward the horse that sanchez had ridden into the clearing,novel
"wow, that's pretty cool. did you get to ride the horse or did you have to run?",chit-chat
he would have no difficulty in getting to the horse he saw,novel
he would have no difficulty getting to the horse he saw. he would not be able to get out of the house.,chit-chat
but his escape was all that he could negotiate,novel
that's what i was thinking. it's like he didn't even try.,chit-chat
a glance told him that the _se単orita_ was not in sight and he had no time to search the entire camp for her,novel
that's a bummer. how long did it take for him to find the camp?,chit-chat
the pirates were rushing toward him from every side attracted by the tumult,novel
the tumult? i've never heard of that before. what does it mean?,chit-chat
barbados behind him was shrieking commands and foul oaths,novel
"i've never been to barbados, but i'd love to go there one day.",chit-chat
the dagger held between his teeth se単or zorro dodged the two men before the hut and vaulted into the saddle kicked at the animals flanks and was away,novel
"wow, that's pretty intense. i'm glad you were able to get away.",chit-chat
behind him a pistol barked but the ball flew wild and he could hear the insane roar of rage that barbados gave because he had missed the target,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never been to barbados. what's the name of barbados?,chit-chat
it was a flying target now,novel
oh no! i hope it wasn't a big one. what did you do to it?,chit-chat
se単or zorro bent low over the horses neck and kicked frantically at the animals flanks again,novel
i love se単or zorro! he's such a great singer and songwriter.,chit-chat
straight across the clearing he guided the animal toward the trail that ran to the crest of the slope,novel
that's pretty cool. what kind of animal is it? i've never seen one before.,chit-chat
another pistol roared behind him but he did not even hear the shrill whistling of the flying ball,novel
oh no! that's terrible. i hope he didn't get hurt too bad.,chit-chat
he wished that he might make a search for the _se単orita_ but he was afraid that capture might result if he tried it,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's able to find it soon.,chit-chat
and were he captured again barbados would make short work of him,novel
"i'm not sure if he was captured or not, but i don't know for sure.",chit-chat
it were better to get away free and return later to rescue,novel
that's a good idea. i'm glad you were able to get away and rescue.,chit-chat
he was approaching the edge of the camp now,novel
that's good to hear. i'm glad he's doing well. what do you do for fun?,chit-chat
he knew that there were some mounts with saddles and bridles on and that there might be a pursuit,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he didn't get hurt.,chit-chat
once over the crest he would have a chance,novel
that's what i'm thinking. he's a great player and i hope he does well.,chit-chat
the pirates would not dare follow him too close to san diego de alc叩la and that was only eight miles away,novel
i'm not familiar with san diego de alc叩la. what's it like there?,chit-chat
and then he saw just ahead of him captain ram坦n,novel

the _commandante_ was drinking from a bottle and talking to some women of the camp,novel
"that's pretty cool. i've never been to a camp, but i'd like to go one day.",chit-chat
he whirled around when he heard the mad pounding of the horses hoofs and se単or zorro saw his face go white as he struggled to get his sword from its scabbard,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad he didn't have to deal with that.,chit-chat
the _commandante_ had recognized him,novel
what did they recognize him for? i don't think i've ever seen him before.,chit-chat
the women shrieked and fled,novel

captain ram坦n his sword out stood his ground,novel
"captain ramoned his sword to stand his ground, stood his ground... did he?",chit-chat
straight toward him se単or zorro raced his horse bending forward his dagger held in his right hand again,novel

now he wished he had his beloved sword,novel

it missed se単or zorro and struck the horse on the rump inflicting a minor cut,novel

in that instant as he watched the singing zorro racing up the slope toward the crest captain ram坦n realized that his future was hanging by a very thin thread,novel
"i love zorro, he is one of my favorite characters. he is such a great character.",chit-chat
were he to protect his own interests he must move swiftly,novel
"i think so, but i don't know. i'm not sure what to do.",chit-chat
he sensed that se単or zorro would make a mad ride for san diego de alc叩la and pour a story into the ear of the _commandante_ of the _presidio_ there,novel
"i've never been to san diego, but i'd love to go. have you ever been?",chit-chat
and it was highly imperative that captain ram坦n tell a far better storyand tell it first,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'd rather read a good book than watch a bad movie.",chit-chat
ram坦n managed to return his sword to its scabbard and then he raced with what speed he could toward barbados and the others who were following lurchingly in se単or zorros wake,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never seen se単or zorros wake before.,chit-chat
he grasped barbados by an arm and hurried him aside,novel
"i've never been to barbados, but i'd love to go there one day.",chit-chat
what happened the _commandante_ demanded,novel

the fellow tricked us in some fashion barbados declared with an oath,novel
"i'm not familiar with barbados, but i know that they are a sovereign nation in north america.",chit-chat
his hands were untied and he had a dagger,novel
"oh wow, that's pretty cool. i'm glad he's doing well.",chit-chat

when i have my hands upon him again therell be no delay ill have him imprisoned in the _presidio_ the captain promised,novel
that's very nice of you. i'm sure you'll have a great time.,chit-chat

that's a good way of looking at it. i'm not sure if i'll do that.,chit-chat
i say it yet once againyou should be a pirate one of the men understanding more than his fellows had fetched the captains own horse with saddle and bridle on,novel
i'm not sure i follow. are you saying that againyou should be a pirate because he has a horse?,chit-chat
the captain sprang into the saddle,novel

ill lead the troopers straight into the trap then he touched spurs to the animal he bestrode and dashed up the slope in the wake of se単or zorro,novel

he knew the shortest route to the _presidio_ at san diego de alc叩la and he felt quite sure that se単or zorro did not,novel
"wow, that's a long way from me. i've never been to san diego.",chit-chat
reaching the crest of the slope captain ram坦n stopped his horse beneath the trees and watched and listened for a time,novel
that must have been quite an experience. i'm glad you were able to reach the crest of the slope.,chit-chat
from the distance there came to his ears the drumming of a horses hoofs,novel
that's so funny! did you get to see it live or did you have to wait for it to come back?,chit-chat
as he had expected se単or zorro had ridden along the bottom of the ca単on and captain ram坦n knew that such a course would take him at least two miles out of his way,novel
se単or zorro rode along the bottom of the ca単on and captain ram坦n knew that such a course would take him at least two miles out of his way,chit-chat
once in that ca単on a horseman was forced to follow it until he came to the other end,novel
that's so funny! what did he do to get the other side to follow him?,chit-chat
captain ram坦n turned his horses head in another direction and drove home the spurs,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never heard of him before. is he a professional basketball player?,chit-chat
he rode around a hill and emerged upon a flat space across which he raced toward a row of foothills in the distance,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun! how long did it take you to get to that point?,chit-chat
se単or zorro had the start but he was taking the long way,novel
se単or zorro had the start but he was taking the long way too...,chit-chat
aside from an accident captain ram坦n could reach san diego de alc叩la and have his story told before se単or zorro arrived,novel
"that's a good idea. i'm not sure i could do that, though.",chit-chat
the thing had to be done he told himself,novel
that's what i'm thinking. i don't know what to do now.,chit-chat
he would use his authority and have zorro thrown into the guardroom at the _presidio_,novel
he would use his authority and have zorro thrown into the guardroom at the presidioo,chit-chat
he would go back to the pirate camp at the head of the troopers see that the pirates were wiped out to a man release the _caballeros_ and the _se単orita_,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i've never heard of the se単oritae before.",chit-chat
and then there would be other things to do,novel
"that's true, but i'm not sure i could do it all at once.",chit-chat
he would convince the authorities that se単or zorro had been allied with the pirates and that the _caballeros_ had not known of it and have zorro hanged,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i've never heard of zorro hanging before.",chit-chat
he would ask his friend the governor to order the _se単orita_ to wed with him because he had saved her and wiped out the pirate brood and the _se単orita_ would be forced to obey his excellencys command,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. i've never heard of a pirate brood before.",chit-chat
and he would see to it that all men believed he had been true and loyal continually,novel
he would see to it that all men believed he had been true and loyal continually...,chit-chat
if the _se単orita_ spoke out the truth captain ram坦n could smile and say she uttered a falsehood because she did not wish to wed with him,novel
i'm not familiar with the se単orita_. what's it about?,chit-chat
he was guarded against every emergency he felt,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he's doing well.,chit-chat
there was a mere possibility of course that the pirates might be victorious and in such case captain ram坦n would pretend that he had been with the rogues always turn pirate himself and have the _se単orita_,novel
"oh wow, that's interesting. i didn't know ram坦n was a pirate.",chit-chat
but he preferred the other way,novel
that's what i was thinking. i don't know why he would do that.,chit-chat
he thought of these things as he rode,novel
what kind of things did he think of? i've never done anything like that before.,chit-chat
around another hill and down a slope he rushed and when he came to a wide trail that ran toward the distant el camino real he knew that he had distanced se単or zorro,novel
"wow, that's impressive. did you get to see him in person or in person?",chit-chat
yet he rode furiously for he wanted all the time he could have at the _presidio_ before zorro arrived,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think of that. i'm glad he did.,chit-chat
and finally he reached the highway and tore along it like a mad horseman riding on the wind,novel
that's awesome! i'm glad he was able to get out of the way.,chit-chat
the mount beneath him was showing signs of wearying but the captain urged him on,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never seen a mount like that before. what kind of mount was it?,chit-chat
now he was flying past natives huts scattered along the broad highway,novel
that's so sad. i hope he's ok. i'm sure he'll be fine.,chit-chat
children and chickens and swine hurried from his path,novel
"that sounds like a lot of fun. what do you do for a living, if you don't mind me asking?",chit-chat
women came to the doors of the huts to look after him through clouds of dust,novel
that's a good way to look at things. i'm glad he's doing well.,chit-chat
then he could see in the distance the _presidio_ on its little hill and the group of buildings around it,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think of that. i'll have to think about that.,chit-chat
captain ram坦n urged his horse cruelly,novel
"i've never been on a horse, but i'd love to own one one day.",chit-chat
as he approached men turned to watch him,novel
that's a good way to look at it. did you have a good time with him?,chit-chat
before the _presidio_ itself troopers sprang to their feet as men will when there is a feeling of excitement in the air,novel
i'm not sure what you mean. are you talking about the presidiotor?,chit-chat
captain ram坦n stopped his horse in a cloud of dust before the _presidio_ entrance and was out of the saddle before the nearest trooper could seize the bridle,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun! i'd love to go horseback riding one day.,chit-chat
the men saluted but captain ram坦n spent no time in answering their salutes,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to answer your salutes soon.,chit-chat
drawing off his gloves he strode through the entrance and straight toward the office of the _commandante_,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never done that before. what did you do?,chit-chat
he had lied nobly to barbados,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did he do to make you think he did that?,chit-chat
instead of their being a smaller force of soldiers than usual at san diego de alc叩la there was an extra detachment come to relieve others who were to go toward the north,novel
that's really cool. i've never been to san diego de alc叩la.,chit-chat
but only a lieutenant was there by way of officer the real _commandante_ being on a journey to san francisco de asis to explain certain things to the governor,novel
"i've never been to san francisco, but i'd like to go one day.",chit-chat
captain ram坦n opened the office door and strode inside gasping his breath slapping the dust from his uniform,novel
"hello, captain ram坦n. how are you doing today? i just got home from work.",chit-chat
the lieutenant sprang to his feet,novel
"i've always wanted to go to japan, but i'm afraid i'll never get there.",chit-chat
ram坦n he cried,novel

so far from home captain ram坦n stopped him with a gesture,novel
that's really nice of him. i'm sure he's proud of you.,chit-chat
have your trumpeter sound the assembly and gather your men while we talk he commanded,novel

this is seriousand urgent the lieutenant was a good soldier and did not question,novel
that's great to hear. i'm glad to hear he was a good soldier.,chit-chat
he sprang to the door and called an order and almost immediately the commanding notes of a trumpet rang through the place,novel
that's so funny! what kind of music do you like to listen to at the place?,chit-chat
then the lieutenant closed the door and hurried back to the long table in the middle of the room before which ram坦n was sitting,novel
"oh my god, that's terrible. i hate when people do that. what did you do?",chit-chat
pirates within eight miles of you ram坦n declared,novel

the _se単orita_ is of the opinion that he followed to rescue her when in reality he had her stolen,novel
that's interesting. i didn't know he followed to rescue her when in reality he had her stolen.,chit-chat
he was to have married her but is eager for lawlessness it appears,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's able to get over it.,chit-chat

i can't wait to see what happens. i'm sure it will be a lot of fun.,chit-chat
if attend ram坦n interrupted,novel

"that's what i thought, but i'm not sure if it's true.",chit-chat
and then san diego de alc叩la unprotected will be before him the fiend the lieutenant gasped,novel

throw him into the guardroom and put him into the maniacs shirt,novel

then ill help you lead the troopers,novel
"that would be great, thank you so much! i'll be sure to let you know when i'm ready.",chit-chat

se単or zorro? what does that mean? i've never heard of him.,chit-chat
captain ram坦n had been the last person he had seen at the pirates camp he had ridden at great speed and yet here was the _commandante_ ahead of him at the _presidio_ in san diego de alc叩la,novel
"wow, that's impressive. i've never been to san diego, but i'd love to go.",chit-chat
but it did not take se単or zorro long to guess that the captain had taken advantage of some short cut across the country and so had arrived at the _presidio_ first,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of se単or zorro. what's his name?,chit-chat
and since he was here se単or zorro found himself in something of a predicament,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's doing better now. what was the predicament?,chit-chat
for weapons he had only the short dagger and his courage,novel
that's really cool. i've never seen that movie. what's it about?,chit-chat
the element of surprise upon which he generally depended so much was acting against him instead of for him in this present encounter but he did not despair,novel

he took two quick steps forward and the dagger suddenly was in his right hand,novel
oh no! what did he do? did he get hurt? did you call the police?,chit-chat
he glanced quickly at the lieutenant who had picked up his sword from the long table and was drawing it from the scabbard and then whirled toward captain ram坦n who already had his sword ready for use,novel
that's pretty cool. how long did it take him to draw it from the scabbard?,chit-chat
so se単or zorro cried,novel

i've never heard of se単or zorro. i'll have to look him up.,chit-chat

"ha ha ha, ha ha... ha ha!!! haha! ha!",chit-chat
who has not heard of zorro came the reply,novel
i've never heard of zorro. what's his name? i'm not familiar with him.,chit-chat
and it is not to be expected that one of his excellencys officers would go far out of his regular way to do se単or zorro a service,novel

yet an officer will serve his duty and there are certain things to be considered lieutenant,novel

the lieutenant already is planning to ride to the rescue of his men,novel

i can't wait to see him in the playoffs. he's going to be a legend.,chit-chat
it is the truth by the saints,novel
i'm not familiar with the saints. what is it about them that you like so much?,chit-chat

i'm sorry to hear that. it's sad that the pulido family doesn't have the friendship of the governor.,chit-chat
captain ram坦n has preferred a charge against you also,novel
"i don't know who that's, but i'll look it up. what's his name?",chit-chat
you remain in the _presidio_ a prisoner the lieutenant picked up a silver whistle from the table and started to put it to his lips to blow a blast that would call his orderly,novel
"wow, that's interesting. what did you do to get out of the presidioin?",chit-chat
but se単or zorro it appeared had no intention of being kept a prisoner,novel
"yes, se単or zorro had no intentions of being kept a prison, but he had no choice.",chit-chat

the lieutenants whistle was knocked from his left hand but se単or zorro did not succeed in getting possession of the officers sword as he hurled him aside,novel
se単or zorro did not succeed in getting possession of the officers sword as he hurled him aside,chit-chat

captain ram坦n had started toward the door,novel
"i've never heard of ram坦n, but i'm familiar with him. what's his name?",chit-chat

"wow, that's impressive. i've never heard of zorro before. what is his name?",chit-chat
it struck the captains arm and caused him to recoil with a cry of pain,novel
"oh no, that's terrible. i hope he's okay. what did he do?",chit-chat
the lieutenant was young and enjoyed the recklessness of his youth,novel

i must do my work swiftly he had the knife out now and began working at the tough leather of the shirt,novel
that's not good. i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do?,chit-chat
the thong that drew the shirt about the neck was fastened with a metal clasp a sort of lock and so the tough leather had to be cut,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of that before. what's the name of the shirt?,chit-chat
the native sawed through it and loosened the thong,novel
"i'm not sure what you mean by "" loosen the thong "", but i don't think that means what you think it means.",chit-chat
he stopped to slip noiselessly across to the door and crouch and listen there,novel
that's a good way to get out of the house. do you have any other hobbies?,chit-chat
he hurried back and began peeling the leather sack off se単or zorro,novel
"wow, that must have been a long time ago. did you have to clean it up?",chit-chat
he worked frantically guessing what would be in store for him if he happened to be caught,novel

the native slashed the last of the bonds and zorro stood and moved his limbs to restore circulation,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i've never heard of zorro before. what's his name?",chit-chat
then he motioned the native toward the door,novel
that's what i was thinking. i'm glad he didn't do that.,chit-chat
stand on that side zorro directed,novel
i've never heard of zorro. what's it about? have you seen it?,chit-chat
and shriek as though you were being killed the native shrieked,novel

se単or zorro himself felt shivers run up and down his spine at those bloodcurdling shrieks,novel
i've never heard of se単or zorro before. what's his name?,chit-chat
the two soldiers listened and then hurried back toward the guard room,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad they were able to get back to work.,chit-chat
they opened the little aperture in the door,novel
what is the little aperture in the door? i've never heard of it. what is it?,chit-chat
they saw neither of their prisoners but they did see the empty maniacs shirt in one corner of the room,novel
that's pretty funny. what did you do to make them think you were in prison?,chit-chat
and then they did what se単or zorro had judged they would dounlock and open the door and rush inside,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad they didn't do that.,chit-chat
zorro hurled himself upon the first and floored him rolled aside just in time to escape the rush of the second delivered a blow that laid this second on the floor unconscious got the dagger from the soldiers belt and whirled to take the rush of the first now upon his feet again,novel
i love zorro! he's my favorite character in the series. what a great character!,chit-chat
fly he ordered the native,novel

but the fisherman stood just outside the door waiting to see the outcome,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad you were able to see the outcome.,chit-chat
se単or zorro had no quarrel with the soldiery and he did not want to wound a trooper,novel
se単or zorro is one of my favorite characters. he is such a great character.,chit-chat
but it was demanded of him that he make an escape as quickly as possible and make certain that he could not be followed for some minutes,novel
that's a good way of looking at it. i'm glad he didn't do that.,chit-chat
and so he rushed his man with the dagger and the other gave ground and put himself on guard,novel
that's what i was thinking. i'm glad he didn't get hurt.,chit-chat
but suddenly se単or zorro whirled and rushed backward instead of attacking darted through the door slammed it shut and shot home the bar,novel
se単or zorro? that's a name i haven't heard in a long time.,chit-chat
inside were the two soldiers,novel

captain ram坦n riding with the lieutenant at the head of the soldiery considered his plans,novel
"hello captain ram坦n, how are you doing today? i hope you have a great day!",chit-chat
the captain had told barbados how to arrange an ambush at the head of the ca単on and he expected to lead the troopers around the ambush and to the rear cutting the pirates off from their camp and either exterminating them at once in the ca単on or driving them up into the open where the troopers could ride them down one by one,novel
"wow, that sounds like a lot of work. i'm not sure i could do it.",chit-chat
captain ram坦n knew of course and naturally that the pirates would be watching the advance,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never heard of ram坦n before. what's his name?,chit-chat
but just at the mouth of the ca単on captain ram坦n could lead the soldiers swiftly to one side and reach the rear before the pirates could understand the maneuver and hasten back to protect themselves,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think of that. i'll have to think about that.,chit-chat
he had not the slightest doubt regarding the outcome,novel
that's good to hear. it's always good to be confident in your abilities.,chit-chat
the troopers were about equal in numbers to the pirates and while the latter would fight desperately knowing that capture meant the hangmans rope for them the troopers were seasoned men who had been through several native uprisings and knew how to handle themselves in battle,novel
that's interesting. i didn't know that the troopers were seamen.,chit-chat
the soldiers had a few pistols but they were not to be depended on so much as blades and a handtohand conflict,novel
that's interesting. i've always wanted to learn more about the history of the military.,chit-chat
the pirates had a few firearms also but they lacked ammunition,novel
"i don't know much about the pirates, but i do know that they are one of the best teams in baseball.",chit-chat
it would be swords against cutlasses for the greater part captain ram坦n knew and the advantage would be with the troopers swords,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think of that. do you think the troopers would win?,chit-chat
as to his own part ram坦n realized well that barbados would recognize his treachery at once,novel
i've never been to barbados. what's the name of his treachery?,chit-chat
and so there would be no protection for him from the pirates after barbados had passed the word to get him and ram坦n would have to fight with the soldiers as a loyal officer,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think of that. i guess he would have to be a loyal officer.,chit-chat
but he did not doubt the outcome of the combat and so felt secure,novel
that's good to hear. it's always good to be confident in your abilities.,chit-chat
they rode swiftly and in perfect military formation along the dusty highway and presently turned off and galloped across rolling country toward the sea,novel
"wow, that sounds like a lot of fun. did you have a good time with them?",chit-chat
now they proceeded with caution flankers out but they did not slacken speed,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope they didn't get hurt too bad.,chit-chat
it was midafternoon and they wanted to do their work before nightfall,novel
that's a bummer. i'm sure you'll get over it though.,chit-chat
they approached the mouth of the ca単on and captain ram坦n shaded his eyes and peered ahead but could see nothing human,novel
that's interesting. did you see the ca単on and captain ram坦n shaded his eyes and peered ahead but could see nothing human?,chit-chat
the pirates were under cover he supposed waiting for the troopers to ride down into the narrow ca単on and so into a trap from which they could not escape,novel
"oh wow, that's really interesting. i've never heard of a trap like that before.",chit-chat
ram坦n spoke his plans to the lieutenant again and the junior officer nodded that he understood the arrangements perfectly,novel
"hey ram坦n, how are you doing today? i hope you have a good rest of your day.",chit-chat
they came to the ca単ons end but swerved suddenly toward the right and galloped along the rim and up a gentle slope the last before reaching the sea,novel
that's so cool! i'm glad they were able to make it to the sea.,chit-chat
captain ram坦n expected to hear roars of rage from the ca単on but he did not,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
he almost chuckled,novel
what did he do? i don't think i've ever heard of that before.,chit-chat
barbados evidently supposed that the _commandante_ was playing some trick he took it for granted,novel
"i've never been to barbados, but i'd love to go one day. have you ever been?",chit-chat
they reached the crest of the slope and pulled up among the trees and looked down upon the pirate camp,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. did you get to go to the park with them?,chit-chat
a few women and children were running about but they could see no men,novel
that must have been scary. i hope you were able to get out of the situation quickly.,chit-chat
down the slope then turn and gallop back toward the ca単on captain ram坦n instructed,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. i would love to go on a cruise one day.,chit-chat
thus we take them in the rear and have the rogues at our mercy how do you know that they are in the ca単on the lieutenant asked with quick suspicion,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think of that. i'll have to think about that.,chit-chat
did i not hear this se単or zorro make his plans captain ram坦n demanded with some show of anger,novel
"i'm not sure what you're talking about, but i don't know who se単or zorro is.",chit-chat
am i not your superior officer,novel
"no you're not, but i'm sure you'll find out soon enough.",chit-chat
they are now in the ca単on expecting us to gallop into the trap they have planned then they saw us approach the lieutenant declared,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad you were able to get out of there.,chit-chat
_s鱈_ and they are wondering what is happening no doubt,novel
"i'm not sure what's going on, but i hope it's nothing serious.",chit-chat
it is possible that they have seen me at the head of the troopers and have noticed that se単or zorro is not present,novel
i don't think so. i'm sure they've seen you at least once.,chit-chat
but they have not had time to get back to their camp,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get back soon.,chit-chat
their trap has been turned against them,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i don't know what to do now.,chit-chat
forward down the slope swept the troopers and women and children screeched and ran into the huts and buildings,novel
"wow, that must have been scary. i'm glad it wasn't something like that.",chit-chat
in a big circle the soldiers from san diego de alc叩la swerved and started back toward the ca単ons mouth to hem in their foes,novel
"oh wow, that must have been quite an experience. did you have a lot of fun?",chit-chat
and in that instant the _commandante_ found that things were not as he had expected and that he had been fooled,novel
that's a good way to look at it. it's always good to be prepared.,chit-chat
reports of firearms came to his ears bullets whistled among the troopers and some of them fell from their saddles,novel
"wow, that's scary. i'm glad he didn't have to deal with that.",chit-chat
and from the huts and buildings of the pirate camp poured the motley crew of barbados screeching their battlecries eager to wipe out the soldiery that would have tricked and slain them,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. i've never heard of barbados before. do you know much about it?",chit-chat
captain ram坦n cursed and began shouting commands,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to work through it.,chit-chat
the troopers fired their pistols drew their blades and prepared for bloody and more intimate work,novel
have you ever been to the troopers? it's one of my favorite movies.,chit-chat
from behind the largest adobe building dashed a number of mounted pirates barbados and sanchez riding at their head,novel
"wow, that must have been scary. i'm glad they didn't get hurt.",chit-chat
at them the _commandante_ shrieked wildly,novel
i've never heard of that person before. what is it about them that you find so interesting?,chit-chat
forward,novel
have you ever been in a situation where you had to carry a gun? it's a lot of fun.,chit-chat
no mercy the lieutenant who was by far the better field officer was endeavoring to make himself heard above the din,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of no mercy. what's it about?,chit-chat
the pirates and the soldiers clashed fought like maniacs the troopers at the outset having much the better of it,novel
"i've never been to the outset, but i'd love to see it.",chit-chat
but barbados and his mounted pirates joined the battle and fought like fiends because they saw visions of the hangmans noose if they failed to achieve a victory complete,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of the hangmans noose. have you?,chit-chat
captain ram坦n had one close look at the face of barbados and heard the pirate chief shriek traitor at him,novel
that's interesting. i've never been to barbados. what's it like there?,chit-chat
thereafter he managed to keep well in the rear of the fighting under pretense of handling the men,novel
that's good to hear. i'm glad he was able to keep it under control.,chit-chat
his blade was the only one not red,novel
that's pretty cool. did you get to see it in person or in a movie?,chit-chat
ram坦n had no intention of liberating the _caballeros_ until the fight was over for he wanted to claim full credit for rescuing them,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad ram坦n didn't try to save them.,chit-chat
he wanted another talk with the se単orita lolita too before her friends approached her,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of the se単orita lolita before.,chit-chat
she had not given him the promise that he had expected and the necessity for it was over since zorro was free of the pirate camp,novel
that makes a lot of sense. i didn't know zorro was free of the camp.,chit-chat
but ram坦n hoped to get the promise yet and have an immediate marriage saying that he was the one man who could give testimony that would save se単or zorro if he was tried for conspiracy against the governor,novel
i'm not familiar with ram坦n. what does he have to do with se単or zorro?,chit-chat

she was in one of the buildings and captain ram坦n did not know where to find her,novel

she could be held for ransom the pirate chief decided,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure what to do with myself now.,chit-chat
back and forth across the open space up and down the sandy beach the fight progressed,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. what did you do to get away from the fight?,chit-chat
here groups of men were battling like fiends here one pursued a lone enemy,novel
"oh wow, that must have been scary. i hope you were able to get out of there.",chit-chat

that's true. both sides have lost many men and the two forces now are about even.,chit-chat
it came to his mind that unless the soldiers triumphed very soon he would have to release the _caballeros_ and let them join in the fray,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he didn't do that.,chit-chat
back toward the slope the pirates drove the remaining troopers,novel
that's awesome! i've never heard of the pirates before. what's their name?,chit-chat
and there the battle waged at some distance from the burning huts of the pirate camp,novel
"i've never been to a pirate camp, but i'd love to go one day.",chit-chat

clouds of smoke from the burning huts rolled over him surged around him,novel

he choked in the dense smoke his eyes smarted and then pained he tried to see how the fight was going but could only get a glimpse now and then,novel

and then he saw something that caused a thrill of horror to pass through him,novel

one of the burning brands had fallen at the edge of the pile of fuel about the stake,novel

that's what i was thinking. i'm glad he didn't get hurt.,chit-chat
slowly they were eating their way toward him through the heaps of fuel the pirates had dropped,novel
