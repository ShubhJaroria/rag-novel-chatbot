toward the shore they rowed tossing on the breakers making for the dark spot where the cañon ran down into the sea,novel

"wow, that's amazing! i've never been on a cliff, but i'd love to go one day.",chit-chat
through the surf they splashed half naked carrying naught except their weapons and no weapons save their cutlasses,novel

if we stumble across one of the accursed natives slit his throat and so silence it and if we meet a wandering _fray_ of the missions slit him into ribbons sanchez added chuckling,novel
"that's a funny way to put it, but i don't think it's right.",chit-chat
to his wonder barbados grasped his arm so that sanchez thought the bone must break,novel
that's so sad. i'm glad he's ok. what happened to him?,chit-chat
enough of that barbados cried,novel
"i don't know about you, but i've never been to barbados. what's it like?",chit-chat
touch no _fray_ in violence except i give the word you love the robes and gowns sanchez asked in wonder,novel

i love to protect myself barbados replied,novel
"have you ever been to barbados? i've never been, but i'd love to go.",chit-chat
it is an ill thing to assault a _fray_ if it can be avoided he stopped speaking for a moment and seemed to shiver throughout the length and breadth of his gigantic frame,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i don't think i could do that.,chit-chat
i had a friend once who struck a _fray_ he added in a whisper,novel
"wow, that's pretty crazy. did he get in trouble for it or was he able to get away with it?",chit-chat
i do not like to remember what happened to him,novel
"i'm sorry to hear that. what happened to him, if you don't mind me asking?",chit-chat
forward inland they tramped mile after mile keeping to the cañons following an _arroyo_ now and then dodging from dark spot to dark spot while barbados growled curses at the bright moon and sanchez continually admonished the men behind to keep silent,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. do you have any other hobbies you like to do?,chit-chat
it was a journey they disliked but they liked to think of the loot they would find at the end of it,novel
that's a good way to think about it. what did you think of the loot?,chit-chat
on they went toward the sleeping town of reina de los angeles,novel

besides barbados and sanchez few of them had seen the town,novel
"i've never been to barbados, but i'd love to go there one day.",chit-chat
pirates had been treated harshly there when they had wandered inland,novel
i'm not sure what you're talking about. are you talking about the united states?,chit-chat
but now something had happened it appeared that made a raid on the town a comparatively safe enterprise,novel
oh no! that's terrible! i'm so sorry that happened to you. i hope you're okay.,chit-chat
an hour before dawn they stumbled across a native caught him as he started to flee and left his lifeless body behind,novel
"wow, that's crazy. did you find out who it was? did you report it to the police?",chit-chat
then came the day and they went into hiding in a jumble of hills within easy striking distance of the town,novel

they had covered ground well,novel
that's good to hear. it's always good to be prepared for things like that.,chit-chat
sprawled on the sward they slept,novel

barbados a little way aside consulted his poor map once more and then called sanchez to his side,novel
"i don't know much about barbados, but i know it's a country in the caribbean.",chit-chat
since we may have to split our force it were well that you knew more of this business he said,novel

"i've never heard of barbados, but i'm sure it's a fun place to visit.",chit-chat

it never has been raided properly,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you have a safe place to stay.,chit-chat

the town will be wide open for us my friend there is a _presidio_ in reina de los angeles and where there is a _presidio_ there are soldiers sanchez reminded him,novel

i am not afraid of the soldiers,novel
"that's good to hear. what do you do for a living, if you don't mind me asking?",chit-chat

her hands had been touched,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat

he dared not speak of course though the pirates were shouting and singing,novel

that's a good way to look at it. i'm sure i'll look great.,chit-chat
ha,novel
"ha ha ha, ha ha... ha ha!!! haha! ha!",chit-chat
you are pretty enough now to suit any man who is not too exacting he turned back toward the door offering her no affront,novel

and there he waited as though with deep respect,novel
"yes, he did. i was so proud of him. i felt so bad for him.",chit-chat
are you coming he demanded,novel
i don't think so. i'm not sure if i'll be able to.,chit-chat

señor zorro through the tiny crack had witnessed this scene,novel
señor zorro? i've never heard of him. what's his name?,chit-chat
he did not believe that barbados merely wanted her to take the air,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did he do to make her want to take the air?,chit-chat
he felt sudden fear for her and once more his eyes narrowed and seemed to send forth flakes of steel,novel
"wow, that's pretty scary. i hope he didn't get hurt too bad.",chit-chat
he scrambled over the boxes and bales toward the little door,novel
that's awesome! what did you do to get him to do that? did you find out who he was?,chit-chat
up the rickety ladder he went and to the hatch and there he listened for a time hearing nothing alarming,novel
that's really scary. i'm glad you're okay. what did he do?,chit-chat
and then he raised the hatch slowly an inch at a time blinking his eyes rapidly at the bright light of the day,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad he didn't get hurt too bad.,chit-chat
none of the pirates was in sight,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do to make sure they weren't in sight?,chit-chat

"hello, señor zorro. how are you doing today? i hope you are well.",chit-chat
he was in time to see the _señorita_ piloted across the deck to where barbados was standing alone,novel

the crew were forward some sleeping sprawled on the deck others leaning against the rail watching the antics of the flying fish,novel
"i've never been on a boat, but i'd love to go on one one day.",chit-chat
barbados whirled and stood with arms akimbo regarding her narrowly,novel
"i've never been to barbados, but i'd love to go there one day. have you ever been?",chit-chat
she faced him bravely her hands clasped behind her back,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he didn't hurt her.,chit-chat
_señorita_ the pirate said queer things happened during the night,novel
that's interesting. did you find out who did it or did you just assume it was a pirate?,chit-chat
i would question you concerning them is it necessary she asked,novel
"i don't think it's necessary, but i'm not sure what to do.",chit-chat
by my naked blade it is he roared,novel

that's a good way to look at it. i'm not sure i could do that.,chit-chat
he took a step nearer her,novel
"that's a good way to look at it, but i don't think i could do it.",chit-chat

do you not know you are in my power,novel
"i do know you are in my power, but i don't know what you mean by that.",chit-chat
could i not do with you as i pleased and then heave you overboard and tell this important gentleman later that you got the chance and threw yourself into the sea evil glistened suddenly in his eyes and the little _señorita_ recoiled again,novel
"oh my god, that's the best thing i've ever read on the internet.",chit-chat

this is my affair and you will do well to remain silent barbados declared whirling upon him,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope everything turns out well for you and barbados.,chit-chat

tell me all you know about this señor zorro barbados commanded,novel
"i have never been to zorro barbados, but i know that it is a sovereign island in south america.",chit-chat

i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope she's okay. i've been there before.,chit-chat
señor zorro from his place of watching flinched as though he had experienced the indignity and pain himself,novel
señor zorro is one of my favorite characters. he is such a great character.,chit-chat
he wanted to hurl himself forward and to the attack but he realized that it would not last for long,novel
that's a good way to end the day. i hope it didn't hurt too much.,chit-chat
he could not hope to engage the entire ships company though he made a long and running fight of it and emerge from the combat the victor,novel
"wow, that's impressive. did you win the battle or did you lose the ship?",chit-chat
but there came an interruption,novel
what was the interabout? i'm not sure what you mean by inter.,chit-chat
from forward was a hail a sail,novel
from forward was a hail a sail is a great movie. it's one of my favorite movies.,chit-chat
a sail the pirates sprang to their feet,novel
"i've always wanted to sail a sail, but i'm not very good at it.",chit-chat
those who had been sprawled upon the deck asleep awoke,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay. what happened?,chit-chat
barbados forgot the _señorita_ for a moment and turned to look,novel
oh no! i'm sorry to hear that. did you find out who it was?,chit-chat
behind and bearing down upon them swiftly came another ship,novel
that's so sad. i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're ok.,chit-chat
señor zorro knew as did the pirates that she had put out from the land before the dawn and far to the south of where the pirate ship had been at anchor,novel
i have never heard of señor zorro. are you a fan of her?,chit-chat
hope beat suddenly in zorros breast,novel
i've never heard of zoros's breast. what's it like?,chit-chat
she was a trading schooner he could tell even at that distance,novel
that's a good way to look at it. what did you do to make her feel better?,chit-chat
if only she carried audre ruiz and his friends,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a big fan of audre ruze's friends.",chit-chat
it was a question what would happen,novel
what kind of question was it? what was the question about? what did you think would happen?,chit-chat
if she was some honest vessel perhaps she would fall victim to the pirate craft,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure if she's honest or not.,chit-chat
she might not be prepared to fight,novel
i don't think so. i think she's going to have a bad time.,chit-chat
barbados issued a volley of commands,novel
have you ever been to barbados? it's a sovereign island nation in the united states.,chit-chat
the pirate craft turned for a run farther out to sea so that she could tack back and catch the oncoming ship between her and the shore,novel
"oh wow, that's pretty cool. i've always wanted to be a pirate.",chit-chat
lookouts were posted to watch carefully,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to work through it.,chit-chat
sanchez ran here and there echoing the orders of his chief,novel
that's awesome! i've never heard of him before. what's his name?,chit-chat
from his hiding place señor zorro watched now the approaching vessel and now the deck where señorita lolita was standing against the mast forgotten for the moment,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. i'm not familiar with her. what did she do?",chit-chat
were he quite sure that ship carried his friends señor zorro could go into action,novel
"i don't think so, but i'm not sure. it's been a while since i've been on a ship.",chit-chat
for he flattered himself that he would be able to hold his own until the other ship came up,novel
that's a good way to look at it. it's nice to be able to hold your own until the other ship comes up.,chit-chat
it appeared that the other vessel had no intention of running up the coast,novel
"oh no, that's terrible. i hope you were able to get out of there quickly.",chit-chat
she changed her course also and bore after the pirate craft,novel
what did she do after she changed her course and bore after the pirate craft? i don't get it.,chit-chat
señor zorro watched her carefully,novel
"i love señor zorro, he is such a great character. he is my favorite character of all time.",chit-chat
he could not make out her flag,novel
"what did he do? i don't know much about flags, but i've never seen one before.",chit-chat
at the distance he could see nothing except that she was of the type of trading schooner and that she had swift heels,novel
i love swift heels. they're my favorite pair of shoes. what kind of schooner is she?,chit-chat
for she was gaining rapidly as though sailed by experts,novel
that's what i'm thinking. it's hard to believe that she's still so young.,chit-chat
and the pirate craft was foul of bottom needing careening and scraping,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you saying that the pirate craft was foul of bottom needing careening and scraping?,chit-chat
barbados had hurried to the rail and was watching the oncoming ship,novel
"oh wow, that must have been exciting. did you get to see any of the characters?",chit-chat
señorita lolita saw it also but did not seem to realize that it meant hope,novel
señorita lolita is one of my favorite movies. it's such a classic.,chit-chat
perhaps she feared that the ship was but coming into grave danger running into a conflict that would mean capture and death for her crew,novel
"that's a good theory, but i'm not sure if it's true.",chit-chat
señor zorro glanced at the deck and then back at the approaching vessel again,novel
i love señor zorro. he's such a great singer and songwriter.,chit-chat
he saw that another sail was being sent aloft,novel
that's pretty cool. what kind of sail was it? was it a big one?,chit-chat
it was broken out snapped into place the lines tautened,novel
oh no! i'm so sorry to hear that. did you have to replace it?,chit-chat
and señor zorro with difficulty restrained a cheer,novel
i love señor zorro. he is my favorite singer. he was born in hawaii.,chit-chat
on the white expanse of the sail painted there in haphazard fashion but easily made out was a monster z,novel
that's really cool. i've never seen one of those before. what color was it?,chit-chat

out of the depths,novel
"i've never been out of the deep, but i'd like to go one day.",chit-chat
smiling in the face of death señor zorro yet battled to keep from showing his genuine emotions because of the presence of the _señorita_,novel
i've never heard of señoritaos. what's his name?,chit-chat
but in that awful moment when he stood upon the plank looking first at the evil faces of barbados and sanchez and then at the agonized countenance of señorita lolita pulido he knew what torture meant,novel
i can't imagine what that must have been like. i don't think i could do that.,chit-chat
it was not that señor zorro was afraid of death in itselfa thing that must come to every human being in the end,novel
i don't think señor zorro was afraid of death. i think it was more of a fear of the unknown.,chit-chat
but his agony came from a knowledge of what he would leave behind when he took the plunge into the sea,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think of that. i wonder what he would have done if he knew what he was going to do.,chit-chat
the woman he had hoped to make his bride his friends his father his estatehe was leaving them all for the great unknown,novel
that's so sad. i'm sorry you had to go through that. i hope you're doing better now.,chit-chat
and he was young and had not lived his fill of life,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's doing better now than he was when he was younger.,chit-chat
besides he was leaving the _señorita_ in grave danger,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think of that. i'm glad he was safe.,chit-chat
he could only hope that his friends in the vessel behind would be able to be of service to her and that they would know how to avenge him,novel
"that's a good point. i'm not sure if it's true, but i hope it is.",chit-chat
barbados gave his last mocking laugh and señor zorro felt the plank tipping,novel
señor zorro is a great actor. he was born and raised in barbados.,chit-chat
he felt himself losing his balance,novel
that's a good way to look at it. it's hard to lose your balance when you don't know what you're doing.,chit-chat
the heavy weight on his wrists was almost bending him backward,novel
"oh wow, i didn't see that. i'm glad he's okay.",chit-chat
he knew how swiftly it would carry him down into the depths of the sea,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he didn't get hurt.,chit-chat
then would come a brief and useless struggle he supposed a moment of horrorand the end,novel
that's what i was thinking. it's a shame that he didn't do anything about it.,chit-chat
his eyes met those of the _señorita_ yet again,novel
i've never heard of the señoritae. what's it about?,chit-chat
and then it seemed that everything gave way beneath him and he shot downward,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
there came a splash of water as he struck the surfacehe felt its sudden chilland then the waves closed over his head,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad you were able to get out of the water.,chit-chat
he was a famous swimmer but no man can swim with a heavy bar of metal tied to his wrists and those wrists lashed behind his back,novel
"wow, that's crazy. i didn't know he was a famous swimmer. did he have a lot of medals?",chit-chat
mechanically señor zorro protected himself as he struck the water as though for a deep dive,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never heard of señor zorro before.,chit-chat
he drew air into his lungs until it seemed that they would burst,novel
"oh wow, that's scary. i hope he didn't have a heart attack.",chit-chat
he kicked in vain against the downpulling power of the heavy weight,novel
"wow, that's impressive. i've never done that before. how did you do it?",chit-chat
down and down he went into the depths until the light from the surface faded and he found himself in darkness,novel
that's so sad. i'm sorry to hear that. what happened to him?,chit-chat
señor zorro prayed and worked at the same instant,novel
i have never heard of señor zorro. what does he do for a living?,chit-chat
he jerked his wrists from side to side behind his back trying to force them apart,novel
"oh my god, that's terrible. i'm so sorry to hear that. what happened?",chit-chat
he expelled a tiny bit of air now and then as he descended but retained it as much as possible,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad he didn't have to go to the hospital.,chit-chat
often he had played at remaining as long as possible beneath water but it is one thing to do so when a man has the knowledge that he can spring to the surface at any time and quite another when he has reason to believe that he never will reach the surface again at all,novel
that's a good way to look at it. it's hard to believe that he never will reach the surface again.,chit-chat
yet he continued to struggle as he shot downward,novel
that's what i was thinking. i'm glad he's doing better now.,chit-chat
red flashes were before his eyes now and a multitude of faces and scenes seemed to flit before him,novel
i've never seen a flash before. what's it like to be a flash?,chit-chat
in that awful instant he relived half his life,novel
"i know, i was so sad. i can't imagine what that must have been like.",chit-chat
_dios_ he thought,novel
"i'm not sure what that means, but i've never heard it before. what does it mean?",chit-chat
if this be death another tug he gave at his wrists,novel
that's what i'm thinking too. i don't know what to do.,chit-chat
the man who had lashed the heavy weight there had not done his work well,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i've had that happen to me before. it's awful.,chit-chat
perhaps he was too busy watching barbados and fearing him,novel
i don't think so. i think he just wanted to get away from his family.,chit-chat
perhaps he had held a sneaking admiration for this señor zorro who had offered battle to an entire ships company,novel
"that's a good guess, but i don't think so. i'm not sure why he would do that.",chit-chat
however the rope that held the weight gave a trifle,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to recover from it.,chit-chat
señor zorro in his agony realized that,novel
señor zorro is one of my favorites. he is such a great actor.,chit-chat
he tugged again and then pressed his palms close together and drew in his wrists as much as possible,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad he didn't get hurt too bad.,chit-chat
the heavy weight dragging downward pulled the loose loop over the wrists and hands,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're doing better now. what happened?,chit-chat
zorro felt an immediate relief,novel
i love zorro! he's my favorite character. what's your favorite character?,chit-chat
he realized what had happened,novel
that's what i'm thinking. i don't know what to do now.,chit-chat
and then he began his battle to reach the surface,novel
that's awesome! i'm so happy for him. i hope he's doing well.,chit-chat
the weight was gone but his wrists were still lashed together behind his back,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope he's doing better now though.,chit-chat
he kicked and struggled and shot upward,novel
that's not good. i hope he's better now. what did he do?,chit-chat
he expelled more of the precious air his lungs retained,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad to hear that.,chit-chat
his chest was burning his ears were ringing he was almost unconscious because of the pressure of the water he had been forced to endure,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope he's ok. what happened to him?,chit-chat
he saw a glimmer of light but knew that the surface was yet far away,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he didn't get hurt.,chit-chat
and it occurred to him that even the surface did not mean life,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you referring to the fact that the surface does not mean life?,chit-chat
for his wrists were yet bound behind him and he was miles from the shore,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope he's doing better now. what happened to him?,chit-chat
on he went up and up struggling and fighting,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
he jerked at his wrists until they were raw and bleeding but to no avail,novel
"oh my god, that's terrible. i'm so sorry to hear that. what did he do?",chit-chat
those who had lashed his wrists had done better than the one who had fastened the weight to them,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're doing better than that.,chit-chat
and finally he gave a last struggle a last kick and felt the blessed air striking upon his face,novel
i can't wait to see what he does next. i'm sure he'll do great.,chit-chat
he fought to get into the proper position for resting as much as he could,novel
that's good to hear. i'm glad he was able to get in the proper position.,chit-chat
he kept afloat and he drew in great gasps of air and finally reduced his breathing to normal,novel
that's awesome! i'm glad he's doing better now. what did he do?,chit-chat
and then as he rose on the crest of a wave he looked around as well as he could,novel
that's awesome! i'm glad he was able to do that. i've never seen a wave like that before.,chit-chat
the pirate ship was some distance away sailing slowly before a gentle breeze,novel
"oh wow, that must have been exciting! did you get to see any of the ships?",chit-chat
señor zorro found himself floating in her wake,novel
i love señor zorro. he's my favorite character in the series.,chit-chat
he could see men rushing around her deck and up into her rigging but at the distance could not guess their tasks,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm not sure i could do that.,chit-chat
the wave dropped him and lifted him again spinning him halfway around,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never seen a wave like that before. what kind of wave is it?,chit-chat
señor zorro gasped at the risk of swallowing a portion of salt water,novel
i've never heard of señor zorro before. what's his name?,chit-chat
bearing down upon him was the other craft the one with the gigantic z up on the sail,novel
that's so cool! i've never heard of that before. what's the name of the craft?,chit-chat
zorro saw that he was directly in her path,novel
i love zorro! he's such a great character. what's your favorite part about him?,chit-chat
not much hope burned in his breast yet the spirit of combat still lived,novel
"i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's doing better now, though.",chit-chat
he would not give up so long as there was the slightest chance,novel
that's good to hear. i'm glad you have a good relationship with him.,chit-chat
he would fightfightuntil exhausted he sank for the last time toward the bottom of the sea,novel
"wow, that's impressive. i'm sure he's proud of you for doing that.",chit-chat
those on the approaching ship did not see him for they were watching the pirate craft and preparing for the battle that was to come,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never been on a ship before. what kind of battle was it?,chit-chat
he hailed those on board but his voice was drowned by the roar of the water against the schooners bows,novel
that's so sad. i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's feeling better now.,chit-chat
he saw that she would strike him and kicked frantically to work himself to one side of the track she was following,novel
"oh wow, that's pretty crazy. i'm glad he didn't get hurt.",chit-chat
another glance ahead at the pirate craft convinced him that the schooner would not change her course,novel
oh no! what did he do to make you think he was going to change her course?,chit-chat
once more he tugged at his bonds to no avail,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
he felt himself drawn in toward the schooners bows and fought against the pull of the water helplessly,novel
"that's pretty cool. i've never been to a schooners game, but i'd like to go one day.",chit-chat
he was picked up hurled forward whirled around,novel
that's good to hear. i'm glad he's doing well for himself.,chit-chat
had he saved himself from the depths he wondered to be crushed senseless by the bow of the craft that carried his friends,novel
i don't think so. i'm not sure if he saved himself or not.,chit-chat
then she was upon him,novel
"that's what i thought at first, but then i realized it's not true.",chit-chat
he rose with the crest of a wave and was hurled at the bow,novel
that's so cool! did he get hurt at all? was he hurt in any way?,chit-chat
he saw an anchor chain that was loosely looped and a dragging line,novel
"wow, that's impressive. i've never seen a drag line like that before.",chit-chat
if he could but catch one of those and make his way to the deck there might be some chance,novel
"that's what i'm thinking, but i don't know what to do.",chit-chat
once more the sea whirled him and cast him forward,novel
that's so cool! i've never heard of that before. what's it about?,chit-chat
he came against the swinging loop of anchor chain with a crash grasped it was lifted and dropped but held on,novel
"wow, that's impressive. i'm glad you were able to get out of there.",chit-chat
for a moment he rested panting realizing how precarious was his position,novel
that's a good way to look at it. what did you do to make him feel better?,chit-chat
he threw one leg around the swinging chain,novel
"oh wow, that's impressive. i've never done that before. how long did it take him to do that?",chit-chat
how to reach the bowsprit he could not fathom,novel
"i'm not sure how to reach the bowsprit, but i know how to hold my breath.",chit-chat
those above would pay no attention to him and could not hear him if he hailed,novel
that's what i was thinking. i don't know why they would do that.,chit-chat
and to climb that swinging loop of chain would be a task for an athlete with his hands unbound,novel
i don't think i'd be able to do that. i'm not very athletic.,chit-chat
the bow of the ship dipped and señor zorro felt himself soused beneath the water for an instant,novel
i've never heard of señor zorro. what's his name?,chit-chat
he gripped the chain with his hands and his leg and fought to maintain his position,novel
that's really cool. i've never seen a fight like that before. what was the fight about?,chit-chat
his arms were aching and the chain had cut through his clothing already and was chafing at his leg,novel
oh no! i hope he didn't get hurt. i've had that happen to me before.,chit-chat
once more the bow dipped and zorro slipped a few feet along the chain unable to stop his descent,novel
"wow, that must have been scary. what did you do to get him out of the way?",chit-chat
he gripped with his leg again,novel
oh no! that's terrible. i hope he's ok. i'm sure he'll be fine.,chit-chat
his hands came to a stop and he realized that the rope that bound them had found an obstruction,novel
oh no! that's terrible. i hope he was able to get out of there quickly.,chit-chat
zorro worked slowly and carefully with his fingers even as he held on,novel
that's a good way to do it. i'm sure he's used to it.,chit-chat
one of the links of the chain he found was imperfect had cracked and presented on one side a jagged edge,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of that before. did you find it?,chit-chat
hope sang in his breast once more,novel
"i'm sure he did. he's a pretty good singer, and he has a great sense of humor.",chit-chat
but he knew that he would have to work carefully,novel
"that's true, but it's hard when you have to work so hard to get where you want to go.",chit-chat
he did not dare release his hold entirely for a sudden dip of the bow and the quick wash of the water would be enough to sweep him from the chain,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he didn't get hurt too badly.,chit-chat
but he sawed back and forth as well as he could pulling the rope across the rough edge of the chain link,novel
that's what i was thinking. i'm glad he was able to pull the chain across the rough edge of the chain link.,chit-chat
he glanced ahead,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm not sure i could do that.,chit-chat
the ships were not far apart now and the schooner swung a bit to starboard so as to bear down upon the pirate craft from a more advantageous angle,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope the schooner was able to recover quickly.,chit-chat
zorro worked frantically and after a time he felt the rope give,novel
i love zorro. he's such a great heel. he was the first heel to win the ic title.,chit-chat
his wrists were raw and paining,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's doing better now. what happened to him?,chit-chat
his leg was bleeding already,novel
"oh no, that's terrible. i'm so sorry to hear that. what happened?",chit-chat
there were pains in his head and his vision was imperfect but hope sang within him once more,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope he's doing better now. what happened to him?,chit-chat
he sawed and sawed and once more he glanced ahead,novel
that's a good way to look at it. what did he do to deserve that?,chit-chat
it would not be long now before the ships clashed,novel
that's true. it's been a while since i've been on a ship.,chit-chat
he wanted to be up on the deck normal breath in his nostrils and the sword of zorro in his hand to aid his friends to fight his way to the deck of the pirate craft and to the _señoritas_ side,novel
"wow, that sounds like a lot of fun. did you get to meet any of your friends?",chit-chat
the rope gave again,novel

señor zorro was forced to rest for a moment leaning back on the chain,novel

a wave swept him to one side and he thought for an instant that he was gone,novel
that must have been scary. did you get out of the car and get back in the car?,chit-chat
but he regained his balance and continued his sawing,novel
that's what i was thinking. i'm glad he didn't get hurt.,chit-chat
and presently he knew that he was free,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he didn't.,chit-chat
the rope dangled from one wrist only,novel
"oh wow, that must have been scary. how did you manage to get the rope out?",chit-chat
he gave an exclamation of delight and thanks gripped the chain and turned over,novel
that's so nice of him. i'm glad he's doing well now.,chit-chat
he regarded his bleeding wrists hesitated a moment gathered breath and courage and commenced the perilous ascent of the chain,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad he was brave enough to do something like that.,chit-chat
it was a painful and difficult task,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you have to do to get it done?,chit-chat
señor zorro set his teeth into his lower lip and struggled upward foot by foot,novel
"señor zorro is an american singer, songwriter, and actor. what did he do?",chit-chat
the swinging chain slippery from the sea threatened to pitch him back into the water,novel
"wow, that's scary. i hope he's ok. i've never been in a situation like that before.",chit-chat
every few feet he was obliged to stop to gasp for breath and close his eyes for a moment because the pain in his wrists and leg made him weak with nausea,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope he's better now. what happened to him?,chit-chat
he came within a short distance of the vessel slipped back and forced his way upward again,novel
that's pretty cool. did you find out who did it or was it just a coincidence?,chit-chat
and finally he grasped with one hand the chain port and held on,novel
that's what i was thinking. i'm glad he didn't get hurt.,chit-chat
his hope had increased now,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find peace with him.,chit-chat
nothing would make him loose his hold he told himself,novel
that's what i was thinking. i don't know what to do with myself.,chit-chat
a moment he rested then forced his way upward again,novel

the schooner was very close to the pirate ship now,novel

the two ships would crash together in a minute or so he saw,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never been on a ship before. what happened?,chit-chat
he raised his head weakly and took a deep breath and then struggled to his feet ready to spring down to the deck,novel
oh no! i hope he's okay. i'm sure he'll be fine.,chit-chat
his hand went down to whip the sword of zorro from its scabbard,novel

"wow, that's really interesting. i've never heard of him before. what kind of music do you like?",chit-chat

it seemed to him that he was nearing the land but he could not be sure,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i hope he didn't get hurt.,chit-chat
there might be a treacherous current in these waters against which he was expending his strength in vain,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you referring to the current in the water against which he was expending his strength in vain?,chit-chat

he swallowed salt water and spat it out and found that it had made him ill for a time he was stretched across the spar weak sick on the verge of delirium,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's better now. what happened to him?,chit-chat
he fancied that a myriad of pirate vessels were about him bearing down upon him,novel
"wow, that's interesting. what was the myriad of pirate vessels about him?",chit-chat
he saw the pretty laughing face of the señorita lolita in the mist that hung above the sea,novel

he laughed back at her and once again his cracked voice rose in a song _atención_ a _caballeros_ near he felt himself grow suddenly weak,novel
"wow, that's pretty cool. i've never heard of a song like that before.",chit-chat
it seemed to him that the land was near at last but he could not be sure,novel
that's a good way to look at it. it's hard to tell sometimes.,chit-chat
he drew himself upon the spar sprawling across it,novel

and finally it came to him that it was a human voice attempting to beat through his unconsciousness and bring him to an understanding of things,novel

then came the night and once more barbados cursed the bright moon,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're having a good day. do you have any plans for the weekend?,chit-chat
for though his craft showed no lights yet could she be seen from the schooner,novel

back and forth barbados sailed but always failing to shake off the other ship,novel

and when there came the dark hour before dawn he changed his course abruptly and ran before the breeze,novel

and so barbados put off to sea again for he wished if it were possible to go to the land rendezvous without drawing his foes there,novel

if the men of the schooner dared follow him to land they would be annihilated he promised,novel
that's really sweet of him. i'm sure he's a great person.,chit-chat

she left the stool and curled up in a corner on the floor determined to keep awake,novel
"oh my god, that's awful! i'm so sorry to hear that. what did she do?",chit-chat
but she could not,novel

i've never heard of the little señoritae. what's it about?,chit-chat
she got up and hurried to the window and by standing upon one of the empty casks managed to peer out of it,novel

she could see a portion of the camp,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think of that. i'll ask her.,chit-chat
the pirates were arming themselves and rushing here and there like madmen,novel

she could hear the great voice of barbados as he issued his commands,novel

the _señorita_ could see none of it at first for she was on the wrong side of the building,novel
"wow, that must have been scary. i hope you were able to get out of there quickly.",chit-chat
but she could hear the shrieks and cries the ringing of blades the screeches of pain and curses of anger,novel
that's what i was thinking. i'm not sure if i could handle that.,chit-chat
she saw the crew of the schooner attack from the other side and shrieked her horror as the pirates cut them down,novel

hes out there now fighting,novel
that's awesome! i'm so happy for him. i hope he's doing well.,chit-chat
they will make a captive of him the _señoritas_ heart beat wildly,novel
i don't think that's going to happen. i think they're going to do something else.,chit-chat
then it had been zorro she had heard singing in the distance,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad it wasn't zorro.,chit-chat
but in the next instant she told herself that it could not be,novel
"that's a good way to look at it, but it's not always true.",chit-chat
zorro had walked the plank with a weight fastened to his wrists,novel
"wow, that's impressive! did you have a good time walking the planks, or was it just a walk in the park?",chit-chat
the pirates were mistaken,novel
i'm not familiar with the pirates. what's the mistaken about them being mistaken?,chit-chat
it was some other _caballero_ who looked like señor zorro who fought as he fought and acted as he acted,novel
"wow, that's pretty crazy. did you report it to the police or did they find out who it was?",chit-chat
she threw aside the momentary hope and crept toward the woman inez again,novel
that's not good. what did she do to make you think she was going to do that?,chit-chat
if the fight was going against the _caballeros_ if the pirates were to be victors she had scant time,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think of that. i'll have to think about that.,chit-chat
the _señorita_ began acting as she never acted before and though she was new to the game her womans intuition her terror and her desperate need served her well,novel
"hello, how are you doing today? i just got back from a long day at work.",chit-chat
so the pirates are to win she said laughing lightly,novel

and there will be a lot of ransom money and loot how is this inez shrieked,novel
i don't know... i'm not sure what to do with myself.,chit-chat
you a prisoner seem joyful that the rescue is not accomplished i am a prisoner_sí_ the _señorita_ said,novel
i am joyful that the rescue is not accomplished i am a prisoner_sí_ the * señorita_ * said,chit-chat
but perhaps i shall be more soon what mean you the woman gasped,novel
"i'm not sure what you mean by that, but i don't understand what you're trying to say.",chit-chat
perhaps it might have been in my mind that it would be better to have a real man than wed a gentleman of noble blood,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure i'd want to be married to a gentleman of noble blood.,chit-chat
is it not peculiar that barbados took me the night before my wedding ha,novel
"oh no, i'm sorry to hear that. how long did it take you to get to barbados?",chit-chat
can you speak with plain meaning the woman asked,novel
i don't know... i'm not sure what to say to her.,chit-chat
did you believe the story of captain ramón the _señorita_ demanded,novel
i don't think i have ever heard of that. what was the story about it?,chit-chat
i did too at first,novel
it's been a long time since i've done anything like that. i don't think i'll ever be able to do it again.,chit-chat
and then i thought differently,novel
why did you think differently? i'm not sure what you mean by that...,chit-chat

i don't think i'll ever be old enough to be a fat wench.,chit-chat
if you strike me barbados will punish barbados punish me,novel
"i've never been to barbados, but i'd like to go there one day.",chit-chat
ha are you so easily fooled the _señorita_ asked,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you referring to the question i asked?,chit-chat
it is plain to me what is to happen,novel
i don't know. i'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing.,chit-chat
barbados means to have me for himself,novel
have you ever been to barbados? it's a great place to visit. i've been there a few times.,chit-chat
there is no escape,novel
that's true. it's hard to escape when you're in a bad place.,chit-chat
so i may as well make the best of it,novel
that's good to hear. i'm sure you'll have a great time.,chit-chat
and since i am to be the woman of the pirate chief i must be loyal to him,novel
that's awesome! i'm sure he's proud of you for doing what you love.,chit-chat
if things must be so is it strange that i hope he gets much ransom and loot by the devils of hades the woman swore,novel
i don't think it's strange at all. i'm sure he'll be fine.,chit-chat
if i thought this to be truth can you not see that it is the _señorita_ queried,novel
"no, i can't see what you are talking about. are you talking about something else?",chit-chat
captain ramón may have dealings with barbados but it does not follow that captain ramón is to have me,novel
captain ramón may have dealings with barbados but it does not follow him is to have me.,chit-chat
that was just a little falsehood to fool you possibly ha,novel
"i know, i was so shocked. i was like, what are you talking about?!",chit-chat
so you would take my place the woman cried,novel
i don't know if i could do that. i'm not a good person.,chit-chat
the _señorita_ recoiled as the other approached and held up one of her hands,novel
i've never heard of the señorita_ before. what is it?,chit-chat
i have no desire to take your place she declared,novel
"i don't either, but i'm not sure if she's going to let me.",chit-chat
but since i can not help myself what else is there to do i could kill you with my bare hands and then barbados would kill you in turn and go find himself another woman ha,novel
i'm not sure i could do that. i'd have to find another woman first.,chit-chat
i could kill him you could not the _señorita_ said,novel
i'm not sure what you're talking about. what did i say that you couldn't kill him?,chit-chat
the woman inez was quiet for a moment and then you are righti could not she replied,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did she say? did you say anything to her?,chit-chat
there is a way and how wench help me to escape the _señorita_ said,novel
i don't think i've ever heard of that. what's it about?,chit-chat
if i am gone you are in safe possession of the affections of barbados,novel
i'm not sure about that. i've never been to barbados. what is the affections of barbados?,chit-chat
he will not raid again soon will not soon have a chance to find him another woman,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find someone else.,chit-chat
and you can in the meantime win back his love again ha,novel
"that's what i'm trying to do, but i don't know how to do it.",chit-chat
if i aid you to escape he will kill me make it appear that i escaped myself the _señorita_ replied,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. do you think you'll be able to escape?,chit-chat
you are strong,novel
"thank you, i appreciate that. i'm trying to get better at it, but it's hard.",chit-chat
you can tear out that window until it is large enough for me to get through,novel
that's what i'm going to do. i can't wait to see what it looks like.,chit-chat
let him think that there was some tool in the storeroom and that i did the work ha,novel
"haha, that's a good way to look at it. what did you do?",chit-chat
if i thought you were speaking truth very well said the _señorita_,novel
thank you! i'm glad you like it. what's your favorite kind of food?,chit-chat
wait and see whether it is the truth the woman hesitated searching the _señoritas_ face with her keen glance,novel
that's a good idea. i'm not sure if it's true or not.,chit-chat
then she grunted and hurried into the other room while lolita pulido waited in fear and trembling wondering what was to come now,novel
"oh my god, that's so funny. i'm laughing so hard right now.",chit-chat
had the woman gone to tell barbados the story,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by barbados the story. are you referring to something else?,chit-chat
but presently inez returned and she carried a peculiar strip of iron with one sharp end a bit of wreckage perhaps from some illfated ship,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of that before. do you have a source?,chit-chat
watch you at the door on the inside she commanded,novel
i'm not sure what you mean. are you talking about the dog or the cat?,chit-chat
do not go into the other room,novel
i don't know if i want to go into the other room. i'm not sure what to do.,chit-chat
they are still fighting and perhaps there will be time the _señorita_ hurried across to the door hope singing in her heart again,novel
that's a good idea. i'm sure she'll be happy to hear that.,chit-chat
there she watched and listened to the din of battle,novel
i love the din of battle. it's one of my favorite shows. what's your favorite episode?,chit-chat
all would be well if she could escape in the confusion and get away from the camp,novel
that's what i'm worried about. i don't know what to do.,chit-chat
she could reach el camino real and make her way along it,novel
that's a good idea. i'm not sure she's ready for that yet.,chit-chat
if she could reach san diego de alcála she would find friends,novel
have you ever been to san diego de alcála? it's a great city.,chit-chat
she turned and looked at the woman,novel
that's a good thing. i'm glad she didn't do it again.,chit-chat
inez was tearing out the masonry and adobe around the window,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never been to adobe. what's it like?,chit-chat
the metal bars already were inside the room and out of the way,novel
that's not good. i'm sorry to hear that. did you have to clean it up?,chit-chat

"i don't know what that means, but i'm not sure what it means.",chit-chat
i am small and do not need a very large space it is done the woman replied,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're doing well in your life.,chit-chat
she hurried back to the middle of the room and the _señorita_ turned to look,novel
"oh my god, i hate when that happens. what did she do to make you look?",chit-chat
the aperture was large enough she knew at a glance,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad she didn't get hurt.,chit-chat
she could crawl through jump to the ground go up the slope and reach the fringe of trees that she could see in the distance,novel
that's a good idea. i'll try that next time i go up the slope.,chit-chat
once more hope came to her,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get through it.,chit-chat
i must have some old clothesragged and dirty clothes she said,novel

i will leave some of these the woman did not reply but she hurried from the storeroom with a gleam of avarice in her eyes,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get them back.,chit-chat
she was more than willing to trade ragged garments for some of silk and satin,novel
"wow, that's a lot of money. i'm glad you were able to help her.",chit-chat
back she came after a time and the _señorita_ pulled off her gown and put on the ragged one shuddering as she did so not because of the rags but because of the dirt,novel
"oh my god, that's so gross! i'm so sorry to hear that.",chit-chat
she streaked her face with dirt from the floor and washed her hands in it disarranged her hair and threw a ragged shawl over her head,novel
"oh my god, that's so gross! i'm so sorry to hear that.",chit-chat
a woman does not wear a torn shawl a ragged dress and fine slippers at the same time inez observed,novel

the _señorita_ kicked off her slippers and thrust her feet into the filthy sandals the hag furnished her,novel
i've never heard of the señoritae. what's it about?,chit-chat
she hurried to the window the woman before her,novel
i would have done the same thing if i was in that situation. it's so rude of them to do that.,chit-chat
but inez grasped her by an arm and held her back,novel
that's what i was thinking. i'm glad she didn't get hurt.,chit-chat
not that way the woman gasped,novel
"i know, right? i was so shocked that she didn't know what she was doing.",chit-chat
it is too late,novel
"i know, but i can't help it. it's been a long time.",chit-chat
that way is guarded the heart of the _señorita_ sank again,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'll have to keep that in mind.,chit-chat
she scrambled to the top of the cask she had used before and peered out,novel
oh no! did you have to clean it up? i've had that happen to me before.,chit-chat
within sight there were half a dozen men guarding that side of the camp against a possible surprise,novel
"oh wow, that's a lot of men. how did they guard that side of the camp?",chit-chat
if she got through the window they would see her block her path up the slope and toward the trees and investigate,novel
"that's a good idea, i'll try that next time i'm there.",chit-chat
is there no way out the _señorita_ cried in despair,novel
"i don't think so, but i'm not sure if it's a good thing or not.",chit-chat
there is only the front then let me out the front way,novel
that's a good one. it's always nice to have someone to talk to.,chit-chat
the men are fighting and perhaps they will not notice me if i go out that way and make haste up the slope all women and children have been ordered to remain in the huts while there is fighting they will do no more than shriek at me to get inside again the _señorita_ said,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to work through it.,chit-chat

you can pretend that you believe me to be in the store room,novel
"that's a good idea, i'll try that. what do you do for fun?",chit-chat
when they open the door and find me gone find the window torn out theyll think that i did it and got out that way,novel
oh no! that's so scary! did you have to get out of the house?,chit-chat
if anybody is punished it will be the guards outside i am afraid the woman said,novel

and are you not afraid also of seeing another woman in your place here the face of inez grew purple for an instant and her eyes blazed,novel
"no, i am not afraid. i have never seen another woman in my place here the face of inez grew purple for an instant and her eyes blazed",chit-chat
suddenly she strode across to the door opened it and looked out upon the fighting,novel
oh no! what did she do? did you have to get out of the house or what?,chit-chat
she closed the door again and turned back to face the _señorita_,novel
that's pretty funny. what did she do to make you think she was going to do that?,chit-chat
the fighting now is at some distance she said,novel
that's good to hear. i'm glad you're able to work things out.,chit-chat
there is a chance,novel

wait she whirled around to bar the door of the storeroom,novel
"yeah, i was so mad at her for doing that. i felt so bad for her.",chit-chat
the little _señorita_ waited trying to be calm though her heart was pounding at her ribs,novel
"oh no, that's so sad. i'm glad she's okay though.",chit-chat
she was to escape at last,novel

barbados would kill me if he knew give me a dagger the _señorita_ begged,novel
"i've never been to barbados, but i'd love to go there one day.",chit-chat

death would be welcome to the other the woman hesitated a moment and then reached beneath her ragged shawl and drew a dagger out,novel
i don't think i'd be able to do that. i would be so scared.,chit-chat
the _señorita_ clutched it and hid it away in her bosom,novel
"oh my god, that's terrible. i'm so sorry to hear that. are you okay?",chit-chat
for another moment they faced each other,novel

"oh my god, that's terrifying! i'm so glad she didn't get hurt.",chit-chat
and hope turned to black despair once more in the twinkling of an eye,novel

that's pretty cool. i've never been in a situation like that before. what did she do?,chit-chat

she dropped the bar of iron and stood with arms akimbo,novel
"wow, that's impressive. i'm sure she's proud of you for doing that.",chit-chat
so you are captain ramón _sí_ that must be true else you would not have lived to get to this building inez said,novel

she has been kept safe i see you are to claim her what else ha inez gasped,novel
"yes, she has been safe. i'm not sure what i want to do with her.",chit-chat
it flashed through her mind now that barbados really had no personal interest in the _señorita_ and she believed also that she had almost been tricked into aiding an important prisoner to escape,novel
"wow, that's crazy. i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope she's okay.",chit-chat
a glance at the _señoritas_ face confirmed her suspicion for lolita was not acting now,novel
that's interesting. what did she do to make you think she was going to do that?,chit-chat
inez realized that she would have to speak quickly to save herself,novel

and she had enlarged the window and dressed in those rags,novel
that's what i'm talking about. i can't believe she did that.,chit-chat
she intended escaping _señor_,novel

and your present garments are scarce suited to your station in life,novel
"that's true, but i'm not sure if i'll be able to afford them.",chit-chat

i've never pirated anything. i don't know what i would do without them.,chit-chat
a biting tongue in a sweet face captain ramón declared,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do to make him feel better about it?,chit-chat
more biting than the blade you wear at your side _señor_,novel
i'm not sure what you're talking about. what do you mean by that?,chit-chat
why do you not show your true colors,novel
"i don't know, i guess it's because i'm not very good at it.",chit-chat
why not go out and fight with your friends the pirates and thieves and murderers against men of gentle blood captain ramón bowed in mockery,novel
i don't think i could do that. i'm afraid i'd get caught.,chit-chat
if you will be kind enough to glance through the open door _señorita_ you will perceive that the fighting is at an end he replied,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you talking about the dog or the cat?,chit-chat
what _caballeros_ are not dead have been taken prisoners,novel
i don't think i've ever been taken away from my home by a caballero.,chit-chat
and the women and children are mocking them,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you referring to the women or the children?,chit-chat
go hag and mock with the others,novel

ill guard the _señorita_ well he leered at the woman as he spoke and she grinned and shuffled from the building,novel
that's nice of you. i'm sure you'll have a great time.,chit-chat
she was eager to get at barbados and tell him how the _señorita_ had attempted an escape and how she the loyal and faithful inez had prevented it,novel
that's really interesting. i've never heard of the señoritae before.,chit-chat
into the storeroom _señorita_ captain ramón commanded when they were alone,novel
"have you ever been to the storeroom? i've never been, but i'd like to.",chit-chat
i prefer this _señor_ quickly he commanded,novel
that's a good way to look at it. what's your favorite thing about it?,chit-chat

i'm not sure how to close the door. i don't know what to do.,chit-chat
we do not wish to be overheard what mean you can you not understand the captain cried,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
he thrust her before him into the storeroom and closed the door behind him,novel
"wow, that's pretty gross. i'm glad he didn't do it again.",chit-chat
he darted across to the window and looked out acting mysteriously,novel
oh no! what did you do? did you say anything to him or what did he do?,chit-chat
if you would rid me of your foul presence the _señorita_ began,novel
"i don't know what that means, but i'm not sure what it means.",chit-chat
captain ramón whirled toward her,novel
"i'm not sure what that means, but it sounds interesting. are you a captain?",chit-chat
on the long hot ride from reina de los angeles which had taken him the better part of two days and during which he had not spared mounts he had thought out everything,novel
"wow, that sounds like a lot of fun. did you have a good time with him?",chit-chat
he was playing a sort of double game this captain ramón,novel
that's pretty cool. what game was he rambling about? did he win or lose?,chit-chat
he wished to reinstate himself in the good graces of better men he wanted to make the _señorita_ believe that he had rendered her a great service and try to win her regard openly and he wished to aid his master the governor in acquiring credit in the southland where he had small credit now,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i've never heard of him before. what's his name?",chit-chat
he had heard on his way to the pirate camp that señor zorro had walked the plank,novel
"wow, that must have been a long walk. did you get to see señor zorro?",chit-chat
he could take the helpless _señorita_ now for his own but if he did that he would have to become a renegade forever live like an outcast,novel
i don't think he would be able to do that. i think he'd have to go to prison.,chit-chat
and captain ramón loved his uniform and wealth and power,novel
i'm sure he did. it's a shame that he didn't live up to the hype.,chit-chat
so why not play the pirates and honest men against each other and make a double winning,novel
i don't think i could do that. i'm not very good at sports.,chit-chat
he had had ample time to think it out,novel
that's what i'm thinking. i don't know what to do now.,chit-chat
and so as he faced the _señoritas_ scorn he pretended surprise that she did not understand,novel
i don't think i've ever seen a señoritasan before.,chit-chat
foul presence _señorita_ he said,novel
i've never heard of foul presence before. i'll have to look into it.,chit-chat
after i have risked so much to be of service to you of service to me she cried,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
when i was abducted by your orders when my home was burned and my father cut down have the beasts told you that ramón asked,novel
"oh no, i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay.",chit-chat
that is because barbados knew i was infatuated with you,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. why were you infatuated? did you have a bad experience?,chit-chat
he believed i would thank him for doing such a thing you are allied with pirates she accused,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to work things out.,chit-chat
listen _señorita_ for the love of the saints the saints are better off your lips _señor_ attend me he commanded again,novel
i've never heard of this song before. i'll have to check it out.,chit-chat
it is a game we have been playing a sorry game _señorita_ by your gentle blood i ask you to give me your ear,novel
i've never heard of that game before. what's the name of the game?,chit-chat
i have but pretended friendship with these pirates that the soldiers may take them later and hang them all what monstrous falsehood is this she asked,novel
that's not very nice of you. i'm sorry you have to deal with that.,chit-chat
i beg your attention _señorita_,novel
i don't know what that means. i'm not sure what you mean by that.,chit-chat
some of them may be coming soon,novel
i hope so. it's been a long time since i've seen any of them.,chit-chat
i have pretended to be in league with them,novel
why did you pretend to be in league with them? what did you do to make them think you were in league?,chit-chat
they raided reina de los angeles while i and my soldiers were gone,novel
that's terrible. i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're ok.,chit-chat
i have followed swiftly to rescue you,novel
thank you so much! i really appreciate it. i'm so glad you followed me.,chit-chat
they think that i am a friend,novel
why do they think you are a friend? is it because you don't like them?,chit-chat
but now assured of your safety i can act speedily,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i think i'm going to do that.,chit-chat
let them continue thinking for the time being that i accept you as a prize,novel
that's what i'm trying to do. i just don't know what to do with myself.,chit-chat
i shall ride away to san diego de alcála which is but a few miles fetch the troopers from there rescue you release the _caballeros_ now held as prisoners and wipe out this pirate brood but why she began,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. i'm sure you'll have a great time.,chit-chat
it was the only way _señorita_,novel
i've never heard of señoritaos before. what is it about?,chit-chat
the soldiers are few and the pirates have been able to strike the coast where there were no troopers handy,novel
that's good to hear. it's always good to be prepared for the worst.,chit-chat
it is a trap that we have arranged for them,novel
what did you do to get them to do something that they didn't want to do?,chit-chat
perhaps it may not seem a gentle thing to dobut one can not be gentle with pirates i wish that i could believe you she said,novel
i don't think it's a gentle thing to do. i think she's just trying to make me feel better about myself.,chit-chat
believe me _señorita_,novel
i've never heard of you before. what do you do for a living? do you have any hobbies?,chit-chat
i love you so much i am betrothed she said simply,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get through it.,chit-chat
but i have grave news for you,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope it's something you're looking forward to.,chit-chat
i have been told that don diego vega is no more that these beasts forced him as señor zorro to walk the plank i was there she said her eyes filling with tears,novel
"wow, that's so sad. i'm glad don diego is doing better now.",chit-chat
i saw it,novel
what did you see? i can't wait to see what it's like to see it in person.,chit-chat
nevertheless i am betrothed to him _señor_ now and forever in life and in death that is because your grief is new the captain said,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
you are young _señorita_ you have a life to live,novel
"i have a life to live, but i don't have a lot of time for it.",chit-chat
if you would live it with me _señor_ she warned,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to move on with your life.,chit-chat
i can understand why you dislike me a bit he said,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did he say to you that made you dislike him?,chit-chat
perhaps in the past i did some things that a gentleman should not do,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do to make you feel that way?,chit-chat
but it was because of my great love for you because i was afraid of losing you _señor_ let us talk of other things if we must talk the _señorita_ begged,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
do you not realize _señorita_ that if i wish it you are in my power now you are showing your true colors she said,novel
i don't think i have ever heard that before. i'll have to look it up.,chit-chat
not so,novel
i don't think i'll ever be able to do it. it's just not my thing.,chit-chat
i am showing you that i am not taking advantage of the situation he declared,novel
i am showing you that i am not taking advantage of the situation he declared. what situation did he declared?,chit-chat
i intend rescuing you and the friends these pirates now hold as prisoners,novel
that's very kind of you to do. i'm sure you're a nice person.,chit-chat
i am risking my life to do it,novel
that's a good attitude to have. i'm sure you'll do great.,chit-chat
and if i succeed can not you look upon me with some favor if i have misjudged you _señor_ i am indeed sorry she replied,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm sure you'll be fine.,chit-chat
but it is useless to talk of such things,novel
"that's true, but i think it's important to talk to people about it.",chit-chat
my heart is with don diego vega in life and in death perhaps in the future there can be no hope _señor_ captain ramóns face flushed and his eyes blazed for an instant,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i don't know who don diego vega is.,chit-chat
but he still had his game to play the manysided game that he hoped would result in great fortune,novel
"that's true, but it's hard to believe that he didn't win.",chit-chat
if you could only believe me he said,novel
what did he say? i've never heard of that before. what was he saying?,chit-chat
perhapsafter you have demonstrated your loyalty then i go now to talk to barbados then to san diego de alcála for the troopers,novel

and ill return to you before i ride for san diego de alcála if there are more plans you should know captain ramón opened the door bowed low as she passed through it and looked after her with the corners of his lips curled,novel
"i've never been to san diego, but i'd love to go on a ride with you.",chit-chat

captain ramón bade the woman guard the _señorita_ well and then hurried from the adobe building,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never seen the adobe building before. what's the name of the building?,chit-chat
just in front of it he stopped to look over the scene,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he didn't get hurt.,chit-chat
dead men were scattered on the ground at a distance,novel
that's terrible. i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're ok.,chit-chat
there were more dead men around the huts where the crew of the trading schooner had made their last stand,novel

"wow, that's crazy. i'm glad they were able to get away with it.",chit-chat
women and children ran beside them shrieking insults hurling small stones,novel
that's so sad. i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're ok.,chit-chat
but the _caballeros_ held their heads proudly and laughed and jested with one another,novel
the caballeros_ has been around for a long time. they have been around since the late 19th century.,chit-chat
captain ramón darted to the end of the building so he would not be seen by the prisoners,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you were able to get out of the building.,chit-chat
it was not in his mind to be suspected at the outset,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad you didn't get caught.,chit-chat
the game he was playing was one of hazard and he knew that the slightest mistake would be disastrous,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's doing better next season. i've been watching him for a while now.,chit-chat
he had planned with barbados to conduct the raid and thereby had gained the pirate chiefs confidence,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never been to barbados. what's the raid about?,chit-chat
and now he had further plans,novel
that's good to hear. i'm glad he was able to find a way to make it work.,chit-chat
he would tell barbados that he would draw to the camp the troopers at san diego de alcála,novel
i've never been to san diego de alcála. what is it like there?,chit-chat
barbados and his men could ambush them and wipe them out,novel
"i don't know much about barbados, but i do know that it is a sovereign island nation.",chit-chat
then the pirates could cross the hills and raid and loot rich san diego de alcála,novel
i would love to see that. it would be so cool to see how they would react.,chit-chat
but the captain intended no such thing in reality,novel
that's what i was thinking. i'm glad he didn't do it.,chit-chat
knowing how barbados would prepare the ambush he would lead the troopers in such a manner that the pirates would be wiped out to a man,novel
"i'm not familiar with barbados, but i do know that the troopers have been around for a long time.",chit-chat
then the _caballeros_ and the _señorita_ could be rescued and captain ramón would pose as their heroic rescuer,novel
that's a great idea! i'd love to see that. what would you like to see?,chit-chat
he hoped in this manner to regain the good will of the _caballeros_ and a better standing with them and to earn the gratitude of the _señorita_ also,novel
that's a great way to look at it. i'm glad he did that.,chit-chat
word of the exploit would run up and down el camino real,novel
i don't think i've ever heard of that before. what's it about?,chit-chat
men whose hands were now raised against the licentious and unscrupulous governor would think better of him because the pirates had been wiped out,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a fan of the pirates.",chit-chat
the governor in turn would be grateful to captain ramón,novel
the governor in turn would be grateful to captain ramón. he's a great governor.,chit-chat
and he would order don carlos pulido who was not dead of his wound to give the hand of his daughter lolita to captain ramón,novel

don carlos scarce could refuse without endangering his fortunes further,novel
i'm not familiar with don carlos scarce. what's his name? is he a comedian?,chit-chat
it was a pretty plot the plot of a master rogue willing to sell friends and foes alike to advance his own interests,novel
that sounds like a very interesting plot. what did you end up doing to advance your own interests?,chit-chat
captain ramón grinned as he thought of it and twirled his mustache and marched around the corner of the building and across the open space toward where barbados was standing and shouting orders concerning the disposition of the corpses,novel
"hello, captain ramón. how are you doing today? i just got back from barbados.",chit-chat
and suddenly the captain found himself confronted by a man and looked up quickly to see the burning eyes of old fray felipe fastened upon his face,novel
"oh my god, that's so funny! i'm laughing so hard right now.",chit-chat
what does an officer of the governor in such a place unless he be a prisoner of war fray felipe demanded,novel
i don't know. i'm not sure what he does in such a place.,chit-chat
captain ramón bowed before him,novel
i've never heard of a ramoned bowed before. are you a fan of him?,chit-chat
perhaps there are things that you do not understand _fray_ he replied,novel
i don't think so. i'm not sure what he's talking about.,chit-chat
and perhaps _commandante_ there are things that i do understand fray felipe said,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you saying you don't understand what he's saying?,chit-chat
perhaps years of service in behalf of humanity have taught me to read a mans face and mind,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad to hear that.,chit-chat
rogue brute traitor you are a _fray_ and wear a gown that should be respected but do not tempt me too far captain ramón said angrily,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
say your prayers and leave mens work to men the captain bowed again walked around the _fray_ and hurried to the side of barbados,novel
i love barbados. it's my favorite place in the world to visit. have you been there before?,chit-chat
ha the pirate cried,novel
i know right? i was so mad at him for that. i'm glad he's gone now.,chit-chat

there is too much of the fire of anger in her makeup to suit me barbados declared laughing raucously,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
she ripped my forearm with a dagger and killed one of my men aboard ship,novel
"oh my god, that's terrible. i'm sorry you had to go through that.",chit-chat
the taming of her will take more than an hours time _commandante_ leave that to me ramón said,novel
that's what i'm thinking. i don't know what to do with myself.,chit-chat
there are other things to be discussed now and what step aside ramón commanded,novel
i don't think i'm ready for that. it's been a long time since i've been in a relationship.,chit-chat
they walked some distance to a spot where they would not be overheard,novel
that's really nice of them to do that. i hope they didn't make a big deal out of it.,chit-chat
you know certainly the meaning of all this ramón said,novel
"yes, i do. it's been a long time since i've been in a relationship.",chit-chat
the governor who hates this southland is eager to have it troubled as much as possible even if he is forced to sacrifice a few of his own men _sí_ barbados said both in question and in affirmation,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's able to make it through.,chit-chat

it was for an insult to me that he put it there,novel
"oh no, what did he do? did you tell him to get out of the house?",chit-chat
it is like a coward to attack a helpless girl,novel

if señor zorro were here but he is not here ramón cried laughing and leering at her,novel
i've never heard of señor zorro. what's his name?,chit-chat
and so again he started toward her and her hand darted to her bosom to snatch out the dagger the woman inez had given her earlier,novel
"wow, that's pretty crazy. i'm glad he didn't hurt her.",chit-chat
but she did not draw out the dagger,novel

the window behind them suddenly was darkened and the light shut off,novel

into the storeroom plunged a man who struggled to get free from the womans clothes he wore over his own,novel

as captain ramón recoiled and the _señorita_ gave a little cry of fright the intruders head flew up,novel

chapter xxi,novel

over the crest of the slope the animal beneath him plunged down into a ravine and galloped along it,novel
"wow, that must have been scary. what happened to the animal? did he get hurt?",chit-chat
señor zorro sheathed his sword and held on to the horses mane,novel
señor zorro is my favorite character in the series. he is such a great character.,chit-chat
he bent low to avoid tree branches that promised to sweep him from the animals back,novel
that's not good. i'm sorry to hear that. what did he do?,chit-chat
_dios_ he muttered,novel
i don't think i've ever heard of that before. what does it mean?,chit-chat
this is as bad as the battle some distance the frightened horse traveled and then he made a great circle and returned toward the pirate camp,novel
oh no! that's terrible! i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay.,chit-chat
but señor zorro had no wish to return there too soon lest he be captured in the vicinity,novel
"yes, señor zorro had no wish to return there too soon lest he be captured in the vicinity.",chit-chat
and so he waited until the horse negotiating a slippery incline slackened pace somewhat and slipped easily from the animals back,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad he didn't get hurt too bad.,chit-chat
the horse plunged on,novel
have you ever ridden a horse? it's one of the most popular recreational animals in the world.,chit-chat
señor zorro picked himself up observed his scratches and made a futile effort to brush his clothing,novel
"hey señor, how are you doing today? i just got back from walking my dog.",chit-chat
then he walked to the crest of the slope and looked down toward the sea,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad he didn't get hurt too bad.,chit-chat
he was quite a way from the camp but he could see it in the distance see the dead and wounded on the ground and a crowd of the pirates with their women and children in front of the adobe building that was being used as a prison,novel
"wow, that's horrible. i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's ok.",chit-chat
señor zorro sat down to rest and watch,novel

he knew that he was confronted by a dire emergency and a tremendous task but he refused to admit it to himself,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to work through it.,chit-chat
the _señorita_ was down there and she was to be rescued,novel
that's awesome! i'm glad you were able to rescue her. what did she do?,chit-chat
and don audre ruiz and the _caballeros_ were there to be rescued also,novel
i've never heard of don audre ruiz. what's he up to these days?,chit-chat
señor zorro after a breathing spell got up and walked slowly along the crest of the slope among the stunted and windtwisted trees making certain that he could not be observed from the camp,novel
"wow, señor zorro, that's a name i haven't heard in a long time.",chit-chat
he came a distance nearer and watched for a time again,novel
that's nice of him. what did he do to make you think it was him?,chit-chat
and he saw captain ramón,novel
i've never heard of that. what's it like to be captain ramoned?,chit-chat
if it had been in the mind of señor zorro to await the night before descending into the camp again that idea left his mind now,novel
i've never heard of señor zorro. what's his name?,chit-chat
he hurried forward as speedily as possible stopping now and then to listen for fear some of the pirates may have been sent to search for him,novel
"that's a good way to look at it, but i don't think so.",chit-chat
he did not know could not think how he was to enter the camp in the broad light of day without escaping discovery,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he was able to escape.,chit-chat
and he could do little singlehanded against the victorious pirate crew,novel
i don't know if i could do that. i'm not very good at fighting.,chit-chat
yet the plight of the little _señorita_ called to him for action and he knew that something should be done at once,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to take care of him.,chit-chat
and suddenly he stopped for he had smelled smoke,novel
oh no! i hope he didn't get hurt. i've had that happen to me before.,chit-chat
almost silently he crept forward through the brush and came to a small clearing,novel
that's awesome! what did you do? did you get out of the car and get back in the car?,chit-chat
there he saw a hut from the chimney of which smoke was issuing,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad he didn't have to go through that.,chit-chat
señor zorro circled the hut but saw no human being,novel
señor zorro was one of my favorite characters growing up. he was such an interesting character.,chit-chat
he went to the crest of the slope again and saw a woman struggling down it toward the pirates campa woman bent and old,novel
"wow, that must have been a scary experience. did you find out who she was or what she was doing?",chit-chat
señor zorro guessed then that this was the hut of some aged lawbreaker no longer active in piracy,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i've never been to piracy, but i'd love to go one day.",chit-chat
perhaps the ancient one was down in the camp now that the fighting was at an end and his ancient woman was following to see the excitement,novel
"that's a good theory, but i'm not sure if it's true.",chit-chat
señor zorro approached the hut carefully crept around the corner of it and peered in at the door to find the place empty,novel
"hello, señor zorro. how are you doing today? i hope you are okay.",chit-chat
he rushed inside and sought frantically for what he desired,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i hope he didn't get hurt.,chit-chat
there came a chuckle of delight as he found it,novel
that's great! i'm glad he found it. what did he do with it?,chit-chat
what he desired and found was nothing more than a ragged skirt and a wide dirty shawl,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad you found it. what did you do with it?,chit-chat
señor zorro put them on quickly bent his shoulders and hobbled back among the trees and brush,novel
i have never heard of señor zorro. what does he do for a living?,chit-chat
it was a disguise that would serve for the time being,novel
that's a good way of looking at it. what did you do to deserve it?,chit-chat
beneath the skirt was the sword of zorro ready to be whipped from its scabbard,novel
i love zorro. he's my favorite character in the series. what's your favorite character?,chit-chat
señor zorro felt confident as long as the blade was at his side,novel
señor zorro is one of my favorites. he is such a great actor.,chit-chat
he left the fringe of trees at some distance from the hut and made his way down the slope,novel
"wow, that's pretty impressive. did he get hurt at all? did he die?",chit-chat
as he came nearer the camp he was doubly cautious,novel
that's a good thing to do. i'm glad he didn't get hurt.,chit-chat
the horses had lost some of the fright and were grazing,novel
"oh no, that's terrible! i'm so sorry to hear that. what happened?",chit-chat
the pirates for the greater part were gathered around the adobe building where the _caballeros_ were being held prisoners,novel
"wow, that's crazy. i've never heard of that before. what happened?",chit-chat
the women and children were there too only some of them were still scattered around the camp looking at the dead and wounded,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. it's so sad that people have to go through that.,chit-chat
señor zorro perceived that he had arrived at an opportune time,novel
what did señor zorro do to get there at such an opportune time?,chit-chat
nobody would give any attention to a woman stumbling along toward the scene of excitement,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure i could do that. i don't think i could.,chit-chat
the pirates undoubtedly imagined that zorro had ridden far away perhaps to san diego de alcála for help,novel
i have never been to san diego de alcála. what is it like there?,chit-chat
he approached nearer,novel
that's a good thing to do. i'm glad he didn't approach me.,chit-chat
there were two large adobe buildings and he supposed that the _señorita_ was held prisoner in one of them but he did not know which,novel
"wow, that's crazy. i'm glad he didn't know which one.",chit-chat
then he stopped suddenly and bent his shoulders more,novel
that's what happens when you don't pay attention to what you're doing.,chit-chat
for he saw captain ramón talking to barbados saw the _commandante_ turn and leave the pirate chief and hurry into the nearest adobe building,novel
"that's pretty cool. i've never been to barbados, but i'd like to go one day.",chit-chat
señor zorro guessed that the _señorita_ was there,novel
i've never heard of señor zorro. what's his name?,chit-chat
he hobbled forward again alert to keep a certain distance from any of the pirates or women for he realized that they knew one another well,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he didn't get hurt.,chit-chat
he reached the corner of the building and began to circle it listening intently for the voice he hoped to hear,novel
what was the voice he wanted to hear? i'm sure he didn't want to hear it.,chit-chat
he heard it,novel
that's what i was thinking. i'm glad he didn't say anything.,chit-chat
pretending to be picking up something from the ground señor zorro bent against the wall and listened,novel
have you ever pretended to be picking something up from the ground señor zorro?,chit-chat
he heard captain ramóns statements heard the _señorita_ reply listened with a grim expression on his face while the _commandante_ begged for an embrace,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. what are you going to do with the rest of the day?,chit-chat
it would be perilous to enter that building now señor zorro knew,novel
i don't think señor zorro would have been able to do that.,chit-chat
ramón would call the pirates but perhaps he could be silenced first,novel
that's a good idea. i'll have to think about that. thanks for the idea!,chit-chat
however there could be no hesitation,novel
"that's true, but i'm not sure if it's worth the risk.",chit-chat
the _señorita_ was there being affronted and was to be spared insult,novel
i've never heard of that one. what was it about? i'm not familiar with it.,chit-chat
señor zorro saw the window and guessed that he could manage to struggle through it,novel
señor zorro is such a great character. he's one of my favorite characters.,chit-chat
he raised his head and glanced inside,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he didn't get hurt.,chit-chat
he saw the _señorita_ recoiling the _commandante_ approaching her,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never seen a señoritaian before.,chit-chat
señor zorro hesitated no longer,novel
"señor zorro is an american singer, songwriter, and actor. have you heard of him?",chit-chat
he sprang up and scrambled through the window,novel
oh no! what did he do? did you have to get out of the house or what?,chit-chat
he tore at the womans clothing that clung to him got free of it and whipped out the sword of zorro,novel
"wow, that's impressive. i'm glad he didn't do that to anyone else.",chit-chat
he pressed the _señorita_ to one side out of harms way and confronted his enemy,novel
"wow, that's pretty intense. i hope he didn't get hurt too badly.",chit-chat
his open hand cracked against captain ramóns head,novel
"oh wow, that's interesting. i've never heard of rambo's head before.",chit-chat
and then he stepped back on guard giving the renegade officer his chance though he little deserved it,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a renegade officer.",chit-chat
you are alive the _señorita_ gasped,novel
"i'm not sure what that means, but thank you! i've never heard of it before.",chit-chat

"oh no, i'm sorry to hear that. what's wrong with your eyes?",chit-chat
a price to be paid,novel
what do you mean by a price to be paid? i'm not sure what you mean.,chit-chat
the face of captain ramón turned livid as he struggled to get his sword from its scabbard,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you were able to get the sword back.,chit-chat
there was a look of fear in his countenance too,novel
i don't think i've ever been afraid of anything in my life. i'm glad he's doing well.,chit-chat
zorro he cried,novel
i love zorro! he's my favorite character. what's your favorite character?,chit-chat
señor zorro eh _sí_ zorro came the answer,novel

we have crossed blades before _señor_ and i have marked you,novel
i've never heard of that before. what was the name of the person you marked?,chit-chat
but this time shall be the last,novel
i hope so. it's been a long time since i've been in a relationship.,chit-chat
a fatal wound this time _capitan_,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay. are you okay?,chit-chat
it is an honor that i do not cut you down without giving you the chance to defend yourself captain ramón finally had his sword out and now he was on guard,novel
that's awesome! i'm glad he's on guard now. it's always good to be on guard.,chit-chat
but he could not forget that once before in his life he had crossed blades with señor zorro and zorro had played with him as a cat plays with a mouse and finally had left him for dead after marking him on the forehead,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. i've never heard of zorro before.",chit-chat
and so the captain grew desperately afraid feeling that he had small chance against the better sword play of the other,novel
i don't think i've ever seen a better sword play than when i was a kid.,chit-chat
he sprang back toward the door to the front room but found señor zorro before him blocking the way,novel

señor zorros face assumed an expression of grim determination and he advanced swiftly,novel
señor zorros face assumed an expression of grim determination and he advanced * * swiftly * *,chit-chat
but captain ramón had found another method of protection for the time being,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think of that. i'll have to look into that.,chit-chat
he sprang back beside the _señorita_ grasped her roughly and held her before him shielding his body with hers,novel
"wow, that's pretty intense. i'm glad he didn't hurt her.",chit-chat
and he continued his shouting hoping to attract the attention of barbados and his men,novel

i know you for what you are you are inclined to show bravery now that you know this señor zorro is alive eh he said,novel

but will he live long in the hands of these pirates some of whose friends he has slain,novel

this barbados loves ransom money but don diego vega is one man who never will be ransomed,novel

ha,novel
"ha ha ha, ha ha... ha ha!!! haha! ha!",chit-chat
real torture such as only these beasts of pirates know how to inflict he declared,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you referring to someone who is a pirate?,chit-chat
no man can stand against such a thing for long,novel
"i know, i can't stand it. i don't know what i'm going to do.",chit-chat
he will beg and shriek for the release of death when the pain begins nono she cried,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i don't think i could do that.,chit-chat
and you will be forced to watch it no doubt the _commandante_ continued,novel
i don't think i'll be able to watch it. i'm going to miss it.,chit-chat
barbados his men say is a master hand at torture of all kinds,novel

theyll chip at him with their knives sear his flesh with whitehot brands _señor_ for the love of the saints you do not like the picture,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a fan of whitehot brands.",chit-chat
wait until you see the reality which will be much worse than words could paint if i could save himgive my life for his the captain looked at her sharply,novel
i don't think i'll be able to do that. i can't even imagine.,chit-chat
perhaps there may be a way he said,novel
"that's what i'm thinking, but i don't know what to do.",chit-chat
what mean you i can have speech with this fiend of a barbados and coax him to delay the torture until he has accounted for the troopers from san diego de alcála,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to make it up to him.,chit-chat
the troopers will account for him and his men instead of course and then señor zorro and the _caballeros_ will be released and you will do this she cried,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a fan of the troopers.",chit-chat
ah _señor_ if only you would i can do it _señorita_at a price and whatis the price she asked,novel
i don't know... i'm not sure how much she's willing to pay.,chit-chat
you are the price yourself _señorita_ beast is that a way to save señor zorro by calling me a beast the captain asked,novel

i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to make it up to him.,chit-chat
my heart is not my own can you hesitate the captain asked,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're feeling better. what did the captain say?,chit-chat
one way you will be my wife and señor zorro will be saved from torture and will be set free,novel
"that's a nice way to look at it, but i don't think i could do that.",chit-chat
the other way _señorita_ he will be tortured until he diesand you will come to me unwed oh she gasped,novel
i'm not sure what you're talking about. are you talking about a guy or a girl?,chit-chat
that a man could be such a fiend love drives men to do strange things _señorita_ love she cried,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
you know not the meaning of the word,novel
"i know not the meaning of the word, but i'm not sure what you mean.",chit-chat
to love is to be gentle to cherish and protect i know the meaning as it appeals to me the captain declared,novel
that's a great way to look at it. i'm glad to hear that.,chit-chat
and i have scant time if you are to agree,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. do you have any hobbies you like to do?,chit-chat
fray felipe is in the camp and he can wed us,novel
oh really? i didn't know that. do you think he's going to play?,chit-chat
barbados is afraid to affront a _fray_ and will not see felipe harmed,novel
why are you afraid to affront a * fray_ *? why is that?,chit-chat
so he lets him roam around though he is watched i can not very well _señorita_,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to take care of him.,chit-chat
it is for you to make the decision,novel
i think i'm going to do it. i just don't know what to do.,chit-chat
but i am afraid that the pirates will have their way,novel
why are you afraid of the pirates? do you think they are going to win the world series?,chit-chat
and their way will not be a gentle one can you not be a proper man she cried,novel
i can't be a proper man. i don't want to be a man.,chit-chat
can you not save him without exacting such a payment,novel
i don't know how to do that. i'm not sure what to do.,chit-chat
for once in your life _señor_ can you not show yourself a _caballero_ save him and let him claim you ramón asked,novel
that's a good idea. i'm going to try that next time i see him.,chit-chat
you are asking far too much is there no other way none he replied,novel
that's what i'm thinking. i don't know what to do now.,chit-chat
there are certain things that you must dobe my wife and i will save señor zorro by fetching the troopers from san diego de alcála,novel
that's very kind of you to do. i'm sure she appreciates that.,chit-chat
and afterward you must say that i did but trick the pirates and that you wed me in gratitude for saving you from them such a falsehood would not come easily from my lips _señor_ she said,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're feeling better now. what did you do?,chit-chat
and how can i trust you,novel
i don't know... i'm not sure what to do with myself.,chit-chat
how do i know that you would fetch the troopers i am not afraid to make the bargain he told her,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm not sure if i could do that.,chit-chat
you need not wed me until after the pirates are defeated and the _caballeros_ are released,novel
i don't think i've ever heard of the caballeros_ before. what's it about?,chit-chat
that is fair enough for both is it not,novel
"it is, but i'm not sure if i should be upset about it or not.",chit-chat
but how on the other hand may i be assured that you will not forget your part of the bargain once i have done my share _señor_ she cried her face flaming,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i've had that happen to me before too.,chit-chat
would a daughter of the pulidos break her given word then you give it he asked,novel
"i don't think so, but i'm not sure if it would be a good idea.",chit-chat
not yet she replied firmly,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you referring to the fact that she doesn't have a job?,chit-chat
there are to be certain stipulations _señor_ and they he questioned,novel
i don't think i've ever had a stipulate that i couldn't sleep.,chit-chat
i must see señor zorro alone and speak to him and explain just what i intend to do,novel
señor zorro? i've never heard of him. what's his name?,chit-chat
i would tell him the truththat you will save him and the others if i wed you,novel
that's a good idea. i'm not sure if i can do that though.,chit-chat
i would not have him think that my heart is one that can change so easily ha,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure i'd be able to do that.,chit-chat
after that you would have to save him against his will,novel
"that's what i'm thinking, but i don't know what to do.",chit-chat
he would not accept the sacrifice then will i save him despite himself she declared,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. do you think you'll be able to save him?,chit-chat
and you need not fear for the future in such case _señor_,novel
"i don't fear for the future, but i do worry about what i'm going to do in the future.",chit-chat
once we were wed señor zorro would not raise his hand against you if i asked him not to do so perhaps it may be arranged captain ramón said,novel
señor zorro? that's a name i haven't heard in a long time.,chit-chat
he was plotting more even as he spoke,novel
what did he say? i don't think i've ever heard of that before.,chit-chat
he did not see how he could lose in this game,novel
that's too bad. i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he learned his lesson.,chit-chat
if he fetched the troopers and the pirates were wiped out and the _caballeros_ saved the _señorita_ would keep her word if she had given it,novel
i don't think she would have given it to him if he didn't do it.,chit-chat
men might despise him for taking advantage of a situation yet would he be safe,novel
i don't think he would be safe. i'm not sure what to do.,chit-chat
and perhaps for a small sum he could have this señor zorro killed yet,novel
that's what i was thinking. i'm not sure what to do with him.,chit-chat
and if the pirates through some fortune of war managed to be victorious over the troopers then captain ramón could do the other thingsimply seize the _señorita_ give señor zorro up to torture and remain a renegade perhaps even become a pirate chief himself in the future,novel
i'm not sure if i would want to be a pirate chief. i'd rather be a soldier.,chit-chat
i will speak to no other man _señor_only zorro she said as he seemed to hesitate,novel
i will speak to no other man * señor_only zorro * she said as he seemed to hesitate,chit-chat
i will not betray your doubledealing to the pirate crew for that would defeat all our ends and mean death for señor zorro and the _caballeros_ and much worse for me,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what happened to señor zorro and the caballeros_?,chit-chat
but i must speak to señor zorro a moment before i give you my decision in the matter i will try to arrange it with barbados captain ramón replied,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you are able to get it sorted out.,chit-chat
come into the other room and let the woman guard you until i return,novel
that's so nice of you. i'm sure you're a nice person.,chit-chat
you must play the game well if you would be successful,novel
"yeah, i'm pretty good at it. it's just that i don't have the patience for it.",chit-chat
and there is scant time,novel
that's true. it's been a long time since i've been in a relationship.,chit-chat
i should start my ride to san diego de alcála as quickly as possible chapter xxiii,novel
"i've never been to san diego, but i hear it's a great place to visit.",chit-chat
the señorita plots also,novel
have you ever read the señorita plots? it's my favorite book of all time.,chit-chat
captain ramón hurrying outside found barbados in the open space before the other adobe building,novel
"wow, that must have been exciting to see him. did he have a good time there?",chit-chat
the pirate chief it was easy to see had been drinking heavily of rich stolen wine,novel
that's interesting. did you find out who the pirate chief was before you saw him?,chit-chat
among the pirates slain were some of barbadoss particular friends and he was trying to drown his sorrow at their untimely taking off,novel
that's so sad. i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're ok.,chit-chat
he turned as the _commandante_ approached and greeted him with a shout,novel
that's pretty cool. did you say anything to him or did he say something to you?,chit-chat
ha he cried lurching drunkenly,novel
"i'm not sure what drunking is, but i've never heard of it.",chit-chat

what is that? i've never heard of it before. what's it about?,chit-chat
yet your face does not bear the marks of her nails which is strange,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. i don't know what you're talking about.,chit-chat
i would not want the taming of her,novel
"yeah, i don't think i could do that. i'm not sure i could handle it.",chit-chat
by my naked blade i would not attend me the captain commanded grasping the pirate chief by the arm,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you didn't get hurt too badly.,chit-chat
is it your intention to torture this señor zorro your men have taken barbados cursed loudly breathed heavily and squinted his eyes until they were only two tiny slits,novel
"no, i'm not going to do that. i don't want to hurt anyone.",chit-chat
i shall make him squirm and squeal he declared loudly,novel
that sounds like a good way to make him angry. i hope he doesn't do that again.,chit-chat
and then i shall turn him into a proper ghost death is nothing to a man like that captain ramón told him,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to do something about it.,chit-chat
but torture is a different matter then ill see to it that he is prettily tortured barbados declared,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a fan of torture either.",chit-chat
there are two sorts of torture barbadosthe physical and the mental said the captain,novel

i do not understand such things torture to the mind the captain explained,novel
i don't either. i'm not sure what he was trying to explain to the captain.,chit-chat
that is the worst kind by far,novel
i know right? i can't even imagine what it would be like to have to deal with that.,chit-chat
if you would have some sport with this señor zorro whom we both hate listen to me,novel
i'm not familiar with zorro. what's wrong with señor?,chit-chat
the _señorita_ who was to have been his bride is afraid that you will torture and slay him,novel

that's so sweet of you to do. i'm sure she'll love it.,chit-chat

i don't think so. i think it's just the fact that he's not very good at math.,chit-chat
are you a fool questioned the captain,novel
i don't think i'm a fool. i think he's a good captain.,chit-chat
and am i one,novel
"no, you're not. i'm not sure why you'd think so.",chit-chat
there must be no talk of treason between us,novel

and we will taunt him with it the _commandante_ continued,novel
i don't know what to do with myself. i'm so angry at him.,chit-chat
well watch him squirm but it appears to me _capitan_ that in this affair you are acting the part of an ass barbados dared to say,novel
i don't think i'm acting the part of an ass barbados dare to say.,chit-chat
why work so hard to get the wench to agree to wed you when you can take her at your pleasure because it will hurt this señor zorro a great deal more to know that she gives her consent the captain replied,novel
i'm not sure what you're trying to say. are you trying to tell me something i don't understand?,chit-chat
well taunt him about it and then ill ride for the soldiers,novel
that's what i'm going to do. i just don't know what to do with myself.,chit-chat

that's a good point. it's been a long time since i've been in a relationship.,chit-chat
some of these fine enemies must be tortured soon while i am in the proper mood for it and there can be more mental torture the captain said,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get through it.,chit-chat
do not touch him until the very last,novel
i don't think i can do that. i'm not sure what to do.,chit-chat
make him watch as some of his friends are being tortured,novel
that's a good idea. i'm not sure if i can do that though.,chit-chat
let him hear their shrieks of pain,novel
that's a good idea. i think i'm going to do that next time.,chit-chat
let him see don audre ruiz his boon companion suffer,novel
i'm not familiar with don audre. what does he do for a living? do you know him?,chit-chat
that will hurt him as much as being tortured himself ha,novel
i know right? i can't even imagine what it would be like to have to deal with that.,chit-chat

"yeah, it's been a long time since i've been able to do that.",chit-chat
andthere may be a way,novel
"i'm not sure what you mean by that, but i hope you're right.",chit-chat

"wow, that's really interesting. i've never heard of señor zorro before.",chit-chat
his hands now would be free at any time he wished to drop the ends of the cords that bound his wrists,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he's doing better now.,chit-chat
he had a weapon hidden in the sash about his waist,novel
"oh, that's interesting. did you find out who it was or what it was?",chit-chat
given those minor advantages señor zorro felt that he could disconcert his enemies again else fail to be zorro,novel
i don't think señor is zorro. i think he's a bit of a clown.,chit-chat
but the expression in his face did not change as he walked slowly around the room and finally came to a stop before the window and glanced across the clearing and the beach toward the glistening water of the bay,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never been to the glistening water of the bay.,chit-chat
he looked like a man devoid of all hope expecting the worst,novel

barbadoss lieutenant dismounted and allowed the animal to wander near the hut while he hurried in search of the pirate chief with some report,novel
that's pretty cool. what kind of animal did he wander near the hut with some report?,chit-chat
these things señor zorro saw quickly and then he hurried back to the door that opened into the other room,novel
oh no! what did he do? did you have to get out of the other room?,chit-chat
it was barred and locked with a strong lock and zorro had no tools with which to open it,novel
that's pretty cool. did you find out who did it or did you just assume it was zorro?,chit-chat
he could not unfasten it and release his friends but he could hold speech with them,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think of that. i'm glad he was able to do that.,chit-chat
he made certain that nobody was near the window to overhear and then kicked against the door to attract the attention of the _caballeros_,novel
that's a good way to attract attention. what did you do to get the attention of the caballeros?,chit-chat
audre he called in a guarded voice,novel
i've never heard of audre before. i'll have to look it up.,chit-chat
there was silence for a moment and then he heard a whisper from the other side of the door,novel
"oh my god, that's so scary! what did he say to the other side of the door?",chit-chat

the _señorita_ has cut my bonds and given me a dagger,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
it is a poor weapon but better than none,novel
that's what i'm thinking. i don't know what to do with it.,chit-chat
it would avail us nothing for me to let you out if i could for the pirates greatly outnumber us,novel
"i'm sorry to hear that. what do you do for a living, if you don't mind me asking?",chit-chat

the two guards were squatted before the hut wherein the captured weapons had been stored drinking and talking,novel
"wow, that must have been a lot of work. how long did it take for the guards to get there?",chit-chat
other pirates were in the distance walking around stretched in the shade of the huts gambling shouting quarreling,novel
"i've never been to a casino, but i'd love to go one day.",chit-chat
señor zorro knew well that it would profit nothing to get those weapons in the hut for the _caballeros_ could not be liberated quickly and so the element of surprise in an attack would be lost,novel
señor zorro was a very smart man. he knew what he was doing.,chit-chat
moreover were they liberated and their swords in their hands they would only be cut down by the pirate crew after they had taken some toll,novel
"i don't think so, but i'm not sure. it's been a while since i've read the books.",chit-chat
señor zorro wanted his own sword but did not know whether there would be time for him to get possession of it,novel
señor zorro is such a cool character. he's one of my favorite characters.,chit-chat
he would not dare stop to attack the two guards for the other pirates would rush up and endanger his chance for escape,novel
he would not dare stop to attack the two guards for the other pirates would rush up and endanger his chance for escape,chit-chat

"that sounds like a lot of fun, but i'm not sure i could do it.",chit-chat
back to the door he hurried,novel
that's what i was thinking. i'm glad he didn't get hurt.,chit-chat
audre he called softly,novel

that's a good idea. i'm not sure i'd be able to do that.,chit-chat
pretend to be fighting among yourselves he did not have very long to wait,novel
that's a good idea. i'm sure he didn't want to get in trouble.,chit-chat
he could hear don audre ruiz whispering instructions to the other _caballeros_ and almost instantly they began shrieking at one another pounding on the heavy door making a bedlam of noise,novel
"wow, that must have been scary. i hope you were able to get out of the house.",chit-chat
señor zorro hurried across to the outside window and called to the guards before the hut,novel
señor zorro ran across to the outside window and called to the guards before the hut,chit-chat
come here he shouted,novel
i don't know what i'm going to do when i hear him say that.,chit-chat
the prisoners are fighting and slaying one another but they refused to leave their posts as señor zorro had hoped they would do,novel
that's terrible. i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do to them?,chit-chat
instead they shrieked the news at barbados who was not far away and he ran toward the adobe building followed by sanchez and half a dozen of the men,novel
"wow, that's crazy. i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope he's okay.",chit-chat
they unbarred the door and burst in upon señor zorro who stood back against the wall gazing at the door of the adjoining room as though trying to decide what was taking place inside,novel
"wow, that must have been scary. did you find out what was going on in the room?",chit-chat
from the other side of that door came shrieks and cries and the sounds of blows,novel
oh no! what happened to the other side of the door? did you call the police?,chit-chat
fiends of hell barbados swore,novel
have you ever heard of fiends of hell barbados swear? it's a british tv series.,chit-chat
they will slay one another and then there will be neither torture nor ransom,novel
i don't think they will do that. they've been doing it for a long time.,chit-chat
unfasten that door and stand ready to drive them back if they try to make an escape,novel
that's a good idea. i'll have to do that next time i see them.,chit-chat
and two of you guard that outside door also one glance he flung at señor zorro to find him standing against the wall as if his attention were concentrated on the other room,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm not sure i could do that.,chit-chat
but as barbados turned toward the door again señor zorro shifted along the wall for a distance of a few feet and glanced toward the door through which he would have to go to freedom,novel
señor zorro... that's a name i haven't heard in a long time.,chit-chat
he waited until the other door was about to be thrown open until the pirates in the room had their attention centered there and then señor zorro dropped the severed cords from his wrists wriggled his fingers for an instant to restore the circulation of blood and suddenly brought his hands around in front of him and tore the dagger from his sash where the little _señorita_ had put it,novel
"wow, that's pretty intense. i'm glad he didn't get hurt.",chit-chat
forward he hurled himself just as the other door was opened,novel
oh no! that's terrible. i hope he's okay. what did he do?,chit-chat
he took the two men before him by surprise,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad he didn't have to do that.,chit-chat
one he hurled aside the other he was forced to wound slightly to get him out of the way,novel
that's so sad. i hope he's ok. what did he do to hurt you?,chit-chat
past them he dashed even as they shrieked the intelligence that he was escaping,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he was able to escape.,chit-chat
out into the open he darted and straight toward the horse that sanchez had ridden into the clearing,novel
"wow, that's pretty cool. did you get to ride the horse or did you have to run?",chit-chat
he would have no difficulty in getting to the horse he saw,novel
he would have no difficulty getting to the horse he saw. he would not be able to get out of the house.,chit-chat
but his escape was all that he could negotiate,novel
that's what i was thinking. it's like he didn't even try.,chit-chat
a glance told him that the _señorita_ was not in sight and he had no time to search the entire camp for her,novel
that's a bummer. how long did it take for him to find the camp?,chit-chat
the pirates were rushing toward him from every side attracted by the tumult,novel
the tumult? i've never heard of that before. what does it mean?,chit-chat
barbados behind him was shrieking commands and foul oaths,novel
"i've never been to barbados, but i'd love to go there one day.",chit-chat
the dagger held between his teeth señor zorro dodged the two men before the hut and vaulted into the saddle kicked at the animals flanks and was away,novel
"wow, that's pretty intense. i'm glad you were able to get away.",chit-chat
behind him a pistol barked but the ball flew wild and he could hear the insane roar of rage that barbados gave because he had missed the target,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never been to barbados. what's the name of barbados?,chit-chat
it was a flying target now,novel
oh no! i hope it wasn't a big one. what did you do to it?,chit-chat
señor zorro bent low over the horses neck and kicked frantically at the animals flanks again,novel
i love señor zorro! he's such a great singer and songwriter.,chit-chat
straight across the clearing he guided the animal toward the trail that ran to the crest of the slope,novel
that's pretty cool. what kind of animal is it? i've never seen one before.,chit-chat
another pistol roared behind him but he did not even hear the shrill whistling of the flying ball,novel
oh no! that's terrible. i hope he didn't get hurt too bad.,chit-chat
he wished that he might make a search for the _señorita_ but he was afraid that capture might result if he tried it,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's able to find it soon.,chit-chat
and were he captured again barbados would make short work of him,novel
"i'm not sure if he was captured or not, but i don't know for sure.",chit-chat
it were better to get away free and return later to rescue,novel
that's a good idea. i'm glad you were able to get away and rescue.,chit-chat
he was approaching the edge of the camp now,novel
that's good to hear. i'm glad he's doing well. what do you do for fun?,chit-chat
he knew that there were some mounts with saddles and bridles on and that there might be a pursuit,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he didn't get hurt.,chit-chat
once over the crest he would have a chance,novel
that's what i'm thinking. he's a great player and i hope he does well.,chit-chat
the pirates would not dare follow him too close to san diego de alcála and that was only eight miles away,novel
i'm not familiar with san diego de alcála. what's it like there?,chit-chat
and then he saw just ahead of him captain ramón,novel
that's awesome! i'm so happy for him. i hope he's doing well.,chit-chat
the _commandante_ was drinking from a bottle and talking to some women of the camp,novel
"that's pretty cool. i've never been to a camp, but i'd like to go one day.",chit-chat
he whirled around when he heard the mad pounding of the horses hoofs and señor zorro saw his face go white as he struggled to get his sword from its scabbard,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad he didn't have to deal with that.,chit-chat
the _commandante_ had recognized him,novel
what did they recognize him for? i don't think i've ever seen him before.,chit-chat
the women shrieked and fled,novel
are you a woman or a man? i'm a woman and i don't think i'd be able to do that.,chit-chat
captain ramón his sword out stood his ground,novel
"captain ramoned his sword to stand his ground, stood his ground... did he?",chit-chat
straight toward him señor zorro raced his horse bending forward his dagger held in his right hand again,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never heard of señor zorro. what's his name?,chit-chat
now he wished he had his beloved sword,novel
that's what i was thinking. i'm glad he didn't have it.,chit-chat
but ramón sprang out of the way just in time and swung his blade in a vicious blow,novel
that's not good. i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're ok.,chit-chat
it missed señor zorro and struck the horse on the rump inflicting a minor cut,novel
"oh no, that's terrible. i hope you're able to get it fixed.",chit-chat
it had the effect however of frightening the animal more,novel
"that's true. i'm glad it didn't happen to me, though.",chit-chat
up the slope he raced and señor zorro sat straight in the saddle and shrieked at the top of his voice _atención_ a _caballeros_ near it was not merely in a spirit of bravado,novel
i've never heard of señor zorro. what's his name?,chit-chat
it was to let the little _señorita_ know if she did not already that he was free and riding wildly for help,novel
that's so sweet of her. i'm sure she's very happy for you.,chit-chat
chapter xxv,novel
i've been reading a lot of xxchapter lately. it's one of my favorite novels. have you read it?,chit-chat
at the presidio,novel
have you ever heard of the presidio? it's an american rock band from los angeles.,chit-chat
in that instant as he watched the singing zorro racing up the slope toward the crest captain ramón realized that his future was hanging by a very thin thread,novel
"i love zorro, he is one of my favorite characters. he is such a great character.",chit-chat
were he to protect his own interests he must move swiftly,novel
"i think so, but i don't know. i'm not sure what to do.",chit-chat
he sensed that señor zorro would make a mad ride for san diego de alcála and pour a story into the ear of the _commandante_ of the _presidio_ there,novel
"i've never been to san diego, but i'd love to go. have you ever been?",chit-chat
and it was highly imperative that captain ramón tell a far better storyand tell it first,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'd rather read a good book than watch a bad movie.",chit-chat
ramón managed to return his sword to its scabbard and then he raced with what speed he could toward barbados and the others who were following lurchingly in señor zorros wake,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never seen señor zorros wake before.,chit-chat
he grasped barbados by an arm and hurried him aside,novel
"i've never been to barbados, but i'd love to go there one day.",chit-chat
what happened the _commandante_ demanded,novel
"i'm not sure, but i don't think i'll be able to sleep tonight.",chit-chat
the fellow tricked us in some fashion barbados declared with an oath,novel
"i'm not familiar with barbados, but i know that they are a sovereign nation in north america.",chit-chat
his hands were untied and he had a dagger,novel
"oh wow, that's pretty cool. i'm glad he's doing well.",chit-chat

reaching the crest of the slope captain ramón stopped his horse beneath the trees and watched and listened for a time,novel
that must have been quite an experience. i'm glad you were able to reach the crest of the slope.,chit-chat
from the distance there came to his ears the drumming of a horses hoofs,novel

señor zorro rode along the bottom of the cañon and captain ramón knew that such a course would take him at least two miles out of his way,chit-chat

captain ramón turned his horses head in another direction and drove home the spurs,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never heard of him before. is he a professional basketball player?,chit-chat
he rode around a hill and emerged upon a flat space across which he raced toward a row of foothills in the distance,novel

señor zorro had the start but he was taking the long way,novel
señor zorro had the start but he was taking the long way too...,chit-chat
aside from an accident captain ramón could reach san diego de alcála and have his story told before señor zorro arrived,novel
"that's a good idea. i'm not sure i could do that, though.",chit-chat
the thing had to be done he told himself,novel
that's what i'm thinking. i don't know what to do now.,chit-chat
he would use his authority and have zorro thrown into the guardroom at the _presidio_,novel
he would use his authority and have zorro thrown into the guardroom at the presidioo,chit-chat
he would go back to the pirate camp at the head of the troopers see that the pirates were wiped out to a man release the _caballeros_ and the _señorita_,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i've never heard of the señoritae before.",chit-chat
and then there would be other things to do,novel
"that's true, but i'm not sure i could do it all at once.",chit-chat
he would convince the authorities that señor zorro had been allied with the pirates and that the _caballeros_ had not known of it and have zorro hanged,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i've never heard of zorro hanging before.",chit-chat
he would ask his friend the governor to order the _señorita_ to wed with him because he had saved her and wiped out the pirate brood and the _señorita_ would be forced to obey his excellencys command,novel

and he would see to it that all men believed he had been true and loyal continually,novel
he would see to it that all men believed he had been true and loyal continually...,chit-chat
if the _señorita_ spoke out the truth captain ramón could smile and say she uttered a falsehood because she did not wish to wed with him,novel
i'm not familiar with the señorita_. what's it about?,chit-chat
he was guarded against every emergency he felt,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he's doing well.,chit-chat
there was a mere possibility of course that the pirates might be victorious and in such case captain ramón would pretend that he had been with the rogues always turn pirate himself and have the _señorita_,novel
"oh wow, that's interesting. i didn't know ramón was a pirate.",chit-chat
but he preferred the other way,novel
that's what i was thinking. i don't know why he would do that.,chit-chat
he thought of these things as he rode,novel
what kind of things did he think of? i've never done anything like that before.,chit-chat
around another hill and down a slope he rushed and when he came to a wide trail that ran toward the distant el camino real he knew that he had distanced señor zorro,novel
"wow, that's impressive. did you get to see him in person or in person?",chit-chat
yet he rode furiously for he wanted all the time he could have at the _presidio_ before zorro arrived,novel

and finally he reached the highway and tore along it like a mad horseman riding on the wind,novel

the mount beneath him was showing signs of wearying but the captain urged him on,novel

women came to the doors of the huts to look after him through clouds of dust,novel
that's a good way to look at things. i'm glad he's doing well.,chit-chat
then he could see in the distance the _presidio_ on its little hill and the group of buildings around it,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think of that. i'll have to think about that.,chit-chat
captain ramón urged his horse cruelly,novel
"i've never been on a horse, but i'd love to own one one day.",chit-chat
as he approached men turned to watch him,novel

before the _presidio_ itself troopers sprang to their feet as men will when there is a feeling of excitement in the air,novel
i'm not sure what you mean. are you talking about the presidiotor?,chit-chat
captain ramón stopped his horse in a cloud of dust before the _presidio_ entrance and was out of the saddle before the nearest trooper could seize the bridle,novel

the men saluted but captain ramón spent no time in answering their salutes,novel

he had lied nobly to barbados,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did he do to make you think he did that?,chit-chat
instead of their being a smaller force of soldiers than usual at san diego de alcála there was an extra detachment come to relieve others who were to go toward the north,novel
that's really cool. i've never been to san diego de alcála.,chit-chat
but only a lieutenant was there by way of officer the real _commandante_ being on a journey to san francisco de asis to explain certain things to the governor,novel
"i've never been to san francisco, but i'd like to go one day.",chit-chat

"hello, captain ramón. how are you doing today? i just got home from work.",chit-chat
the lieutenant sprang to his feet,novel
"i've always wanted to go to japan, but i'm afraid i'll never get there.",chit-chat

this is seriousand urgent the lieutenant was a good soldier and did not question,novel

he sprang to the door and called an order and almost immediately the commanding notes of a trumpet rang through the place,novel

then the lieutenant closed the door and hurried back to the long table in the middle of the room before which ramón was sitting,novel

he was to have married her but is eager for lawlessness it appears,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's able to get over it.,chit-chat

captain ramón had been the last person he had seen at the pirates camp he had ridden at great speed and yet here was the _commandante_ ahead of him at the _presidio_ in san diego de alcála,novel
"wow, that's impressive. i've never been to san diego, but i'd love to go.",chit-chat

and since he was here señor zorro found himself in something of a predicament,novel

for weapons he had only the short dagger and his courage,novel

he took two quick steps forward and the dagger suddenly was in his right hand,novel
oh no! what did he do? did he get hurt? did you call the police?,chit-chat

but it was demanded of him that he make an escape as quickly as possible and make certain that he could not be followed for some minutes,novel
that's a good way of looking at it. i'm glad he didn't do that.,chit-chat
and so he rushed his man with the dagger and the other gave ground and put himself on guard,novel
that's what i was thinking. i'm glad he didn't get hurt.,chit-chat

"hello captain ramón, how are you doing today? i hope you have a great day!",chit-chat
the captain had told barbados how to arrange an ambush at the head of the cañon and he expected to lead the troopers around the ambush and to the rear cutting the pirates off from their camp and either exterminating them at once in the cañon or driving them up into the open where the troopers could ride them down one by one,novel
"wow, that sounds like a lot of work. i'm not sure i could do it.",chit-chat
captain ramón knew of course and naturally that the pirates would be watching the advance,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never heard of ramón before. what's his name?,chit-chat

as to his own part ramón realized well that barbados would recognize his treachery at once,novel
i've never been to barbados. what's the name of his treachery?,chit-chat
and so there would be no protection for him from the pirates after barbados had passed the word to get him and ramón would have to fight with the soldiers as a loyal officer,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think of that. i guess he would have to be a loyal officer.,chit-chat
but he did not doubt the outcome of the combat and so felt secure,novel
that's good to hear. it's always good to be confident in your abilities.,chit-chat
they rode swiftly and in perfect military formation along the dusty highway and presently turned off and galloped across rolling country toward the sea,novel

down the slope then turn and gallop back toward the cañon captain ramón instructed,novel

_sí_ and they are wondering what is happening no doubt,novel
"i'm not sure what's going on, but i hope it's nothing serious.",chit-chat
it is possible that they have seen me at the head of the troopers and have noticed that señor zorro is not present,novel

reports of firearms came to his ears bullets whistled among the troopers and some of them fell from their saddles,novel

his blade was the only one not red,novel
that's pretty cool. did you get to see it in person or in a movie?,chit-chat

she had not given him the promise that he had expected and the necessity for it was over since zorro was free of the pirate camp,novel
that makes a lot of sense. i didn't know zorro was free of the camp.,chit-chat
