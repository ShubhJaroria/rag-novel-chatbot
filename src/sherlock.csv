to sherlock holmes she is always _the_ woman,novel
"i've never seen that show, but i know it's based on a true story.",chit-chat
i have seldom heard him mention her under any other name,novel
i've never heard him mention her under any other name either. what is her name?,chit-chat
in his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex,novel
"oh wow, that's interesting. i've never heard of that before. what does it look like?",chit-chat
it was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for irene adler,novel
irene adler is such a great character. i love her so much. she's one of my favorite characters.,chit-chat
all emotions and that one particularly were abhorrent to his cold precise but admirably balanced mind,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did he do to make you feel that way?,chit-chat
he was i take it the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i don't think i could do that.,chit-chat
he never spoke of the softer passions save with a gibe and a sneer,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. it must have been hard for him to be able to do that.,chit-chat
they were admirable things for the observerexcellent for drawing the veil from mens motives and actions,novel
"that's a good point, i didn't think of that. i'm glad they were able to do that.",chit-chat
but for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think of that. i'm not sure what to do now.,chit-chat
grit in a sensitive instrument or a crack in one of his own highpower lenses would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his,novel
i don't think i would be able to do that. i'm not sure i could do it.,chit-chat
and yet there was but one woman to him and that woman was the late irene adler of dubious and questionable memory,novel
i'm not sure what you're talking about. are you talking about someone else?,chit-chat
i had seen little of holmes lately,novel
"i've never seen it, but i hear it's really good. what's it about?",chit-chat
my marriage had drifted us away from each other,novel
"oh no, i'm sorry to hear that. how long have you two been together?",chit-chat
my own complete happiness and the homecentred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment were sufficient to absorb all my attention while holmes who loathed every form of society with his whole bohemian soul remained in our lodgings in baker street buried among his old books and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition the drowsiness of the drug and the fierce energy of his own keen nature,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. i've never heard of holmes before. what's his name?",chit-chat
he was still as ever deeply attracted by the study of crime and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. did you find out who he was or what he did?",chit-chat
from time to time i heard some vague account of his doings of his summons to odessa in the case of the trepoff murder of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the atkinson brothers at trincomalee and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of holland,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. i've never heard of him before. do you know who he was?",chit-chat
beyond these signs of his activity however which i merely shared with all the readers of the daily press i knew little of my former friend and companion,novel
"i'm sorry to hear that. what happened to your former friend, if you don't mind me asking?",chit-chat
one nightit was on the twentieth of march 1888i was returning from a journey to a patient for i had now returned to civil practice when my way led me through baker street,novel
that's awesome. i'm glad you were able to get back on your feet.,chit-chat
as i passed the wellremembered door which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing and with the dark incidents of the study in scarlet i was seized with a keen desire to see holmes again and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers,novel
"that's really interesting. i've never read scarlet, but i know it's a great book.",chit-chat
his rooms were brilliantly lit and even as i looked up i saw his tall spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind,novel
"wow, that must have been scary. did you find out who he was or what he looked like?",chit-chat
he was pacing the room swiftly eagerly with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him,novel
"oh my god, that's so disgusting! did he have to clean up after himself?",chit-chat
to me who knew his every mood and habit his attitude and manner told their own story,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he's doing well.,chit-chat
he was at work again,novel
what do you do for a living? do you have any other hobbies besides work?,chit-chat
he had risen out of his drugcreated dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem,novel
that's so sad. i'm sorry to hear that. what was the problem?,chit-chat
i rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own,novel
that's awesome! i'm glad you were able to get out of the house.,chit-chat
his manner was not effusive,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did he do that was not effusive?,chit-chat
it seldom was but he was glad i think to see me,novel
that's good to hear. it's always nice to have someone to talk to.,chit-chat
with hardly a word spoken but with a kindly eye he waved me to an armchair threw across his case of cigars and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad you were able to get away with it.,chit-chat
then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion,novel
oh no! what did he look like? did he have a good reason for doing that?,chit-chat
wedlock suits you he remarked,novel
i don't know what wedlock means. i'm not sure what that means.,chit-chat
i think watson that you have put on seven and a half pounds since i saw you seven i answered,novel
i have put on seven and a half pounds since i saw you seven! that's a lot of weight!,chit-chat
indeed i should have thought a little more,novel
i'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing...,chit-chat
just a trifle more i fancy watson,novel
what do you fancy watson? i've never heard of it before. what's it about?,chit-chat
and in practice again i observe,novel
that's good to hear. i'm sure you'll have a great time.,chit-chat
you did not tell me that you intended to go into harness then how do you know i see it i deduce it,novel
i didn't want to go into harness. i'm not sure what you mean by that.,chit-chat
how do i know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl my dear holmes said i this is too much,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
you would certainly have been burned had you lived a few centuries ago,novel
i'm sure i would have been. it's been a long time since i've been burned.,chit-chat
it is true that i had a country walk on thursday and came home in a dreadful mess but as i have changed my clothes i cant imagine how you deduce it,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get your money back.,chit-chat
as to mary jane she is incorrigible and my wife has given her notice but there again i fail to see how you work it out he chuckled to himself and rubbed his long nervous hands together,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i don't think i could do that to my wife.,chit-chat
it is simplicity itself said he my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe just where the firelight strikes it the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts,novel
"wow, that's a lot of cuts. i've never heard of that before.",chit-chat
obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it,novel
i don't think that's true. i think it's more likely that it was an accident.,chit-chat
hence you see my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather and that you had a particularly malignant bootslitting specimen of the london slavey,novel
"i've never been to london, but i'd love to go there one day.",chit-chat
as to your practice if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger and a bulge on the right side of his tophat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope i must be dull indeed if i do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession i could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction,novel
"haha, that's pretty funny. i'm not sure i could do that.",chit-chat
when i hear you give your reasons i remarked the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that i could easily do it myself though at each successive instance of your reasoning i am baffled until you explain your process,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i don't think i could do it myself.,chit-chat
and yet i believe that my eyes are as good as yours quite so he answered lighting a cigarette and throwing himself down into an armchair,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
you see but you do not observe,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure if i've ever observed something like that before.,chit-chat
the distinction is clear,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you referring to the difference between the two?,chit-chat
for example you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room frequently how often well some hundreds of times then how many are there how many,novel
"i'm not sure of the exact number, but i know it's a lot.",chit-chat
i dont know quite so,novel
i don't either. i'm not sure what i want to do with my life.,chit-chat
you have not observed,novel
"i have, but i'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing.",chit-chat
and yet you have seen,novel
"i haven't seen her yet, but i'm sure i'll see her soon.",chit-chat
that is just my point,novel
what is your point? i'm not sure what you're trying to say...,chit-chat
now i know that there are seventeen steps because i have both seen and observed,novel
"wow, that's a lot of steps! i'm sure you're very proud of yourself.",chit-chat
by the way since you are interested in these little problems and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences you may be interested in this he threw over a sheet of thick pinktinted notepaper which had been lying open upon the table,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. i've never heard of a pinktinted notepaper before.",chit-chat
it came by the last post said he,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad it worked out for you. what did you end up doing?,chit-chat
read it aloud the note was undated and without either signature or address,novel
that's a good idea. i didn't think of that. i'll have to do that.,chit-chat
there will call upon you tonight at a quarter to eight oclock it said a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment,novel
"i'm not sure what that means, but i hope it's a good one.",chit-chat
your recent services to one of the royal houses of europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated,novel
that's very nice of you to say. i'm very trusting of the royal family.,chit-chat
this account of you we have from all quarters received,novel
that's awesome! i'm so happy for you! i hope you have a great day!,chit-chat
be in your chamber then at that hour and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask this is indeed a mystery i remarked,novel
that's what i'm going to do. i don't know what to do now.,chit-chat
what do you imagine that it means i have no data yet,novel
i don't know... i guess i'll just have to wait and see.,chit-chat
it is a capital mistake to theorise before one has data,novel
"that's true, but i don't think i'm going to let it get to me.",chit-chat
insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories instead of theories to suit facts,novel
that's a good way to look at it. what's your favorite fact about it?,chit-chat
but the note itself,novel
"i know, i was so happy when i found out it was a note from a friend.",chit-chat
what do you deduce from it i carefully examined the writing and the paper upon which it was written,novel
i don't know. i'm not sure. it's been a while since i've done anything like that.,chit-chat
the man who wrote it was presumably well to do i remarked endeavouring to imitate my companions processes,novel
that's really nice of you to do that. what kind of companions do you have?,chit-chat
such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet,novel
"i know, right? it's like they don't know what they're doing.",chit-chat
it is peculiarly strong and stiff peculiarthat is the very word said holmes,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you trying to say that it's too strong?,chit-chat
it is not an english paper at all,novel
i don't know what i would do if i had to write a paper about it.,chit-chat
hold it up to the light i did so and saw a large e with a small g a p and a large g with a small t woven into the texture of the paper,novel
that's pretty cool. did you find out who did it or was it someone else?,chit-chat
what do you make of that asked holmes,novel
i don't know... i'm not sure what to make of it.,chit-chat
the name of the maker no doubt or his monogram rather not at all,novel
i'm not a big fan of monogram's either. they're not very good.,chit-chat
the g with the small t stands for gesellschaft which is the german for company it is a customary contraction like our co p of course stands for papier now for the eg let us glance at our continental gazetteer he took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves,novel
the g stands for gesellger which is the german for company it is a customary contraction like our co p of course stands for papier now for the eg let us glance at our continental gazetteer he took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves,chit-chat
eglow eglonitzhere we are egria,novel
i've never heard of eglow eglonitzhere before. what is it about?,chit-chat

remarkable as being the scene of the death of wallenstein and for its numerous glassfactories and papermills ha ha my boy what do you make of that his eyes sparkled and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette,novel
i've never heard of wallenstein. what's it like to be alive?,chit-chat
the paper was made in bohemia i said,novel
that's interesting. what was the paper about? i've never heard of bohemia.,chit-chat
precisely,novel
i love to go to the gym. it's a great way to meet new people.,chit-chat
and the man who wrote the note is a german,novel
"oh wow, i didn't know that. that's really interesting. do you know who wrote it?",chit-chat
do you note the peculiar construction of the sentencethis account of you we have from all quarters received a frenchman or russian could not have written that,novel
i'm not sure what you're talking about. are you talking about something else?,chit-chat
it is the german who is so uncourteous to his verbs,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you talking about the german who is so uncourto his verbs?,chit-chat
it only remains therefore to discover what is wanted by this german who writes upon bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you talking about the german who writes upon bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face?,chit-chat
and here he comes if i am not mistaken to resolve all our doubts as he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses hoofs and grating wheels against the curb followed by a sharp pull at the bell,novel
"wow, that's pretty scary. i'm glad you're okay. what did you do?",chit-chat
holmes whistled,novel
have you ever heard of holmes holmes? it's a detective's holmes that specializes in holmes.,chit-chat
a pair by the sound said he,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never heard of that before. what kind of pair was it?,chit-chat
yes he continued glancing out of the window,novel
that's what i was thinking. i'm glad he didn't get hurt.,chit-chat
a nice little brougham and a pair of beauties,novel
i love a nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. what do you do for a living?,chit-chat
a hundred and fifty guineas apiece,novel
"wow, that's a lot of money. what do you do in your spare time?",chit-chat
theres money in this case watson if there is nothing else i think that i had better go holmes not a bit doctor,novel
that's what i'm thinking too. i don't know what to do.,chit-chat
stay where you are,novel
that's what i'm trying to do. i just don't know what to do with myself.,chit-chat
i am lost without my boswell,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find your way back.,chit-chat
and this promises to be interesting,novel
it's going to be a lot of fun. i can't wait to see what they come up with.,chit-chat
it would be a pity to miss it but your client never mind him,novel
"that's true, but it's not like i'm going to miss it.",chit-chat
i may want your help and so may he,novel
thank you so much. i really appreciate it. i've been trying to help him for a long time.,chit-chat
here he comes,novel
"i hope he does, he's the best player in the world right now. i'm happy for him.",chit-chat
sit down in that armchair doctor and give us your best attention a slow and heavy step which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage paused immediately outside the door,novel
"oh my god, i hate when that happens. i've had that happen to me before.",chit-chat
then there was a loud and authoritative tap,novel
that's what i'm talking about... a loud and authoritative tap!,chit-chat
come in said holmes,novel
"i'd love to, but i don't think i'll be able to.",chit-chat
a man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height with the chest and limbs of a hercules,novel
"wow, that's impressive. i'm sure he's a lot of fun to watch.",chit-chat
his dress was rich with a richness which would in england be looked upon as akin to bad taste,novel
"i've never been to england, but i'm sure it's beautiful there.",chit-chat
heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his doublebreasted coat while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flamecoloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i've never heard of astrakhan before. what's his name?",chit-chat
boots which extended halfway up his calves and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of barbaric opulence before.,chit-chat
he carried a broadbrimmed hat in his hand while he wore across the upper part of his face extending down past the cheekbones a black vizard mask which he had apparently adjusted that very moment for his hand was still raised to it as he entered,novel
"wow, that must have been a long time ago. how old were you when you did that?",chit-chat
from the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character with a thick hanging lip and a long straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never seen a man with such a long chin.,chit-chat
you had my note he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked german accent,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. what did you say to him? did he say anything to you?",chit-chat

this is my friend and colleague dr watson who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases,novel

whom have i the honour to address you may address me as the count von kramm a bohemian nobleman,novel

if not i should much prefer to communicate with you alone i rose to go but holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair,novel
oh no! i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay.,chit-chat
it is both or none said he,novel
i don't know. i'm not sure if it's true or not.,chit-chat
you may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me the count shrugged his broad shoulders,novel

at present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon european history i promise said holmes,novel

and i you will excuse this mask continued our strange visitor,novel

to speak plainly the matter implicates the great house of ormstein hereditary kings of bohemia i was also aware of that murmured holmes settling himself down in his armchair and closing his eyes,novel
that's interesting. i'm not familiar with ormstein. what's it about?,chit-chat
our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in europe,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. what did you do to make him think that way?",chit-chat
holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client,novel
"hey holmes, what are you up to today? i just got back from a long day at work.",chit-chat
if your majesty would condescend to state your case he remarked i should be better able to advise you the man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you trying to tell me something i don't know?,chit-chat
then with a gesture of desperation he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad he didn't get hurt too bad.,chit-chat
you are right he cried i am the king,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
why should i attempt to conceal it why indeed murmured holmes,novel

your majesty had not spoken before i was aware that i was addressing wilhelm gottsreich sigismond von ormstein grand duke of casselfelstein and hereditary king of bohemia but you can understand said our strange visitor sitting down once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead you can understand that i am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're doing well in life.,chit-chat
yet the matter was so delicate that i could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to work it out.,chit-chat

that sounds like a lot of fun! what kind of music do you like to listen to?,chit-chat
all the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness gently waving his long thin fingers in time to the music while his gently smiling face and his languid dreamy eyes were as unlike those of holmes the sleuthhound holmes the relentless keenwitted readyhanded criminal agent as it was possible to conceive,novel
"hello, how are you doing today? i just got back from a long day of work.",chit-chat
in his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented as i have often thought the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated in him,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of him before. what do you think of him?,chit-chat
the swing of his nature took him from extreme languor to devouring energy and as i knew well he was never so truly formidable as when for days on end he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his blackletter editions,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's doing better now. what happened to him?,chit-chat
then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition until those who were unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals,novel
that's a very interesting way to look at it. i'm glad you took the time to explain it to me.,chit-chat
when i saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at st jamess hall i felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you were able to get to see him.,chit-chat

that's a good way to look at it. it's always good to have a sense of humor.,chit-chat
here i had heard what he had heard i had seen what he had seen and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque,novel
that's terrible. i'm sorry you had to go through that. what did you do?,chit-chat
as i drove home to my house in kensington i thought over it all from the extraordinary story of the redheaded copier of the _encyclopædia_ down to the visit to saxecoburg square and the ominous words with which he had parted from me,novel

"oh wow, that's pretty interesting. did you find out who he was or did you just assume he was a pawnbrokers assistant?",chit-chat
i tried to puzzle it out but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an explanation,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope it works out for you. what did you end up solving?,chit-chat
it was a quarterpast nine when i started from home and made my way across the park and so through oxford street to baker street,novel

"ha ha ha, ha ha... ha ha!!! haha! ha!",chit-chat

that's so cute! what kind of dog is it? is it a golden retriever?,chit-chat
you may place considerable confidence in mr holmes sir said the police agent loftily,novel
i have never heard of mr holmes sir said the police loftily. what did he say?,chit-chat
he has his own little methods which are if he wont mind my saying so just a little too theoretical and fantastic but he has the makings of a detective in him,novel
that's cool. what kind of methods are they? i'm not familiar with them.,chit-chat
it is not too much to say that once or twice as in that business of the sholto murder and the agra treasure he has been more nearly correct than the official force oh if you say so mr jones it is all right said the stranger with deference,novel
i don't think i've ever heard of the sholto murder. what's it about?,chit-chat

here we are and they are waiting for us we had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning,novel
"oh no, that's terrible. i'm sorry you had to go through that.",chit-chat
our cabs were dismissed and following the guidance of mr merryweather we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door which he opened for us,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad you were able to get away with it.,chit-chat
within there was a small corridor which ended in a very massive iron gate,novel
"oh wow, that must have been scary. did you find out who it was or what happened?",chit-chat
this also was opened and led down a flight of winding stone steps which terminated at another formidable gate,novel
"wow, that's amazing! i've never seen anything like that before. what did you do?",chit-chat
mr merryweather stopped to light a lantern and then conducted us down a dark earthsmelling passage and so after opening a third door into a huge vault or cellar which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes,novel
that's really interesting. did you find out who was in the vault or what happened?,chit-chat
you are not very vulnerable from above holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think about that. i'll have to try that next time.,chit-chat
nor from below said mr merryweather striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm not familiar with mr merryweather. what's his name?,chit-chat
why dear me it sounds quite hollow he remarked looking up in surprise,novel
that's what i'm thinking. i don't know what to do with myself.,chit-chat
i must really ask you to be a little more quiet said holmes severely,novel
"i'm sorry, i don't know much about holmes. what did he do?",chit-chat
you have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition,novel
"yes, i'm so proud of him. he's such a great person. i wish i could say the same for him.",chit-chat
might i beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes and not to interfere the solemn mr merryweather perched himself upon a crate with a very injured expression upon his face while holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and with the lantern and a magnifying lens began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones,novel
"that sounds like a lot of fun, but i'm not sure i could do it.",chit-chat
a few seconds sufficed to satisfy him for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket,novel
"oh wow, i didn't see that. i'm glad he was able to clean it up.",chit-chat
we have at least an hour before us he remarked for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope everything goes well for you and your family.,chit-chat
then they will not lose a minute for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape,novel
that's a good point. i guess i'll just have to get used to it.,chit-chat
we are at present doctoras no doubt you have divinedin the cellar of the city branch of one of the principal london banks,novel
"i've never been to london, but i'd love to go there one day.",chit-chat
mr merryweather is the chairman of directors and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of london should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present it is our french gold whispered the director,novel
i've never heard of mr merryweather before. what does he do for a living?,chit-chat
we have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it your french gold yes,novel
that's good to hear. i'm not sure what i'll do with it.,chit-chat
we had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose 30000 napoleons from the bank of france,novel
"wow, that's a lot of money. what did you do to strengthen your resources?",chit-chat
it has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money and that it is still lying in our cellar,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you can find a way to get it back.,chit-chat
the crate upon which i sit contains 2000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil,novel
"wow, that's a lot of luck. i hope you get something good out of it.",chit-chat
our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject which were very well justified observed holmes,novel
that's interesting. i'm not familiar with bullion. what's it like?,chit-chat
and now it is time that we arranged our little plans,novel
"that's great! what plans did you have for your little plans, if you don't mind me asking?",chit-chat
i expect that within an hour matters will come to a head,novel
i'm sure it will. it's always good to have something to look forward to.,chit-chat
in the meantime mr merryweather we must put the screen over that dark lantern and sit in the dark i am afraid so,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get it fixed soon.,chit-chat
i had brought a pack of cards in my pocket and i thought that as we were a _partie carrée_ you might have your rubber after all,novel
oh no! that's terrible! i hope you didn't have to go to the hospital.,chit-chat
but i see that the enemys preparations have gone so far that we can not risk the presence of a light,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to do something about it.,chit-chat
and first of all we must choose our positions,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure what position i want to be in.,chit-chat
these are daring men and though we shall take them at a disadvantage they may do us some harm unless we are careful,novel
that's what i'm worried about. i don't know what to do.,chit-chat
i shall stand behind this crate and do you conceal yourselves behind those,novel
"no, i don't think i'd be able to do that. i'm too scared.",chit-chat
then when i flash a light upon them close in swiftly,novel
that's the worst. i hate it when that happens. it's so annoying.,chit-chat
if they fire watson have no compunction about shooting them down i placed my revolver cocked upon the top of the wooden case behind which i crouched,novel
that's a good idea. i'm glad you didn't have to do that.,chit-chat
holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in pitch darknesssuch an absolute darkness as i have never before experienced,novel
"wow, that must have been scary. did you have to go to the hospital or anything?",chit-chat

"wow, that's a long time. i'm sorry you had to go through that.",chit-chat
my limbs were weary and stiff for i feared to change my position yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension and my hearing was so acute that i could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions but i could distinguish the deeper heavier inbreath of the bulky jones from the thin sighing note of the bank director,novel

"wow, that's really cool. i've never heard of mr windibank before. what do you do for a living?",chit-chat
he laughed i remember and shrugged his shoulders and said there was no use denying anything to a woman for she would have her way i see,novel
that's a funny way to look at it. i'm sorry you had to go through that.,chit-chat
then at the gasfitters ball you met as i understand a gentleman called mr hosmer angel yes sir,novel
i'm not sure what that's supposed to mean. i've never heard of him.,chit-chat
i met him that night and he called next day to ask if we had got home all safe and after that we met himthat is to say mr holmes i met him twice for walks but after that father came back again and mr hosmer angel could not come to the house any more no well you know father didnt like anything of the sort,novel
that's so sad. i'm sorry to hear that. did you find out who he was?,chit-chat
he wouldnt have any visitors if he could help it and he used to say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle,novel
that's sad. i'm sorry to hear that. what did he say to you?,chit-chat
but then as i used to say to mother a woman wants her own circle to begin with and i had not got mine yet but how about mr hosmer angel,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get yours soon.,chit-chat
did he make no attempt to see you well father was going off to france again in a week and hosmer wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had gone,novel
he didn't make an attempt to see me. he said it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had gone.,chit-chat
we could write in the meantime and he used to write every day,novel
"that's a great idea. i wish i could do that, but i don't have the time.",chit-chat
i took the letters in in the morning so there was no need for father to know were you engaged to the gentleman at this time oh yes mr holmes,novel
that's nice of you to do that. i'm sure you'll be fine.,chit-chat
we were engaged after the first walk that we took,novel

i'm sorry to hear that. i've never been to leadenhall streetand.,chit-chat
he said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady so i offered to typewrite them like he did his but he wouldnt have that for he said that when i wrote them they seemed to come from me but when they were typewritten he always felt that the machine had come between us,novel
"wow, that's crazy. i'm sorry you had to deal with that. it must have been very frustrating.",chit-chat
that will just show you how fond he was of me mr holmes and the little things that he would think of it was most suggestive said holmes,novel
that's really sweet of you to say. i'm sure he's a great person.,chit-chat
it has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important,novel
that's great. what little things do you have that make you think they're important?,chit-chat
can you remember any other little things about mr hosmer angel he was a very shy man mr holmes,novel
"i don't know much about mr holmes, but i do know that he was a great actor.",chit-chat
he would rather walk with me in the evening than in the daylight for he said that he hated to be conspicuous,novel
that's a bummer. i'm sorry to hear that. how long have you been together?,chit-chat
very retiring and gentlemanly he was,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's doing well for himself now.,chit-chat
even his voice was gentle,novel
"yes, it was very gentle. i can't wait to see what he does next.",chit-chat
hed had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young he told me and it had left him with a weak throat and a hesitating whispering fashion of speech,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope he's better now. what did he do?,chit-chat

hosmer angel came to the house again and proposed that we should marry before father came back,novel
that's really sweet of him. i hope he's feeling better about it now.,chit-chat
he was in dreadful earnest and made me swear with my hands on the testament that whatever happened i would always be true to him,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did he do to make you swear with your hands on the testament?,chit-chat
mother said he was quite right to make me swear and that it was a sign of his passion,novel
that's good to hear. i'm sure he'll grow up to be a good parent.,chit-chat
mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder of him than i was,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did she do to make you feel that way?,chit-chat
then when they talked of marrying within the week i began to ask about father but they both said never to mind about father but just to tell him afterwards and mother said she would make it all right with him,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. how long did it take for them to get to know each other?,chit-chat
i didnt quite like that mr holmes,novel
why do you didnt like the mr. holmes? he was such a great character.,chit-chat
it seemed funny that i should ask his leave as he was only a few years older than me but i didnt want to do anything on the sly so i wrote to father at bordeaux where the company has its french offices but the letter came back to me on the very morning of the wedding it missed him then yes sir for he had started to england just before it arrived ha,novel
that's really nice of you to do that. i'm sure he appreciated it.,chit-chat
that was unfortunate,novel
it really was. i felt so bad about it. i had to go to the hospital.,chit-chat
your wedding was arranged then for the friday,novel
"yes, it was. i'm so happy for her. it's been a long time since i've been in a relationship.",chit-chat
was it to be in church yes sir but very quietly,novel
"yes, it was in a church. it was very quiet. i felt so bad for him.",chit-chat
it was to be at st saviours near kings cross and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the st pancras hotel,novel
"i've never been to kings cross, but i have been to st. pancras before.",chit-chat
hosmer came for us in a hansom but as there were two of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a fourwheeler which happened to be the only other cab in the street,novel
"oh my god, that's terrible! i'm so sorry that happened to you.",chit-chat
we got to the church first and when the fourwheeler drove up we waited for him to step out but he never did and when the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one there,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad you were able to get to the church.,chit-chat
the cabman said that he could not imagine what had become of him for he had seen him get in with his own eyes,novel
that's really interesting. what did he do to make you think he was a cabman?,chit-chat
that was last friday mr holmes and i have never seen or heard anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him it seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated said holmes,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find out who he was.,chit-chat
oh no sir,novel
"yeah, it was pretty bad. i had to get out of the car to get to work.",chit-chat
he was too good and kind to leave me so,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. how long did it take for you to get back together?,chit-chat
why all the morning he was saying to me that whatever happened i was to be true and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us i was always to remember that i was pledged to him and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
it seemed strange talk for a weddingmorning but what has happened since gives a meaning to it most certainly it does,novel
i don't know... i'm not sure what to do with myself.,chit-chat
your own opinion is then that some unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him yes sir,novel
i don't know... i'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing.,chit-chat
i believe that he foresaw some danger or else he would not have talked so,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he didn't.,chit-chat
and then i think that what he foresaw happened but you have no notion as to what it could have been none one more question,novel
that's true. it's hard for me to believe that he didn't know what he was doing.,chit-chat
how did your mother take the matter she was angry and said that i was never to speak of the matter again and your father,novel
"she didn't want to speak to my dad, but she did want to talk to my mom.",chit-chat
did you tell him yes and he seemed to think with me that something had happened and that i should hear of hosmer again,novel
"i did tell him, but he didn't seem to care. i think i should have told him.",chit-chat
as he said what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church and then leaving me,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get out of that situation.,chit-chat
now if he had borrowed my money or if he had married me and got my money settled on him there might be some reason but hosmer was very independent about money and never would look at a shilling of mine,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get your money back.,chit-chat
and yet what could have happened,novel
that's what i'm worried about. i don't know what to do now.,chit-chat
and why could he not write,novel
"i don't know, maybe he just doesn't have the stamina for it.",chit-chat
oh it drives me halfmad to think of it and i cant sleep a wink at night she pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob heavily into it,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
i shall glance into the case for you said holmes rising and i have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result,novel
i hope so. it's been a long time since i've seen that movie.,chit-chat
let the weight of the matter rest upon me now and do not let your mind dwell upon it further,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're doing well. what's going on?,chit-chat
above all try to let mr hosmer angel vanish from your memory as he has done from your life then you dont think ill see him again i fear not then what has happened to him you will leave that question in my hands,novel
that's a good idea. i'm not sure if i want to see him again.,chit-chat
i should like an accurate description of him and any letters of his which you can spare i advertised for him in last saturdays _chronicle_ said she,novel
that's really nice of you to do. i'm sure he'll appreciate that.,chit-chat
here is the slip and here are four letters from him thank you,novel
"wow, that's a lot of letters. what did you say to him about it?",chit-chat
and your address no,novel
"i live in a small town, so i don't get to see my neighbors much.",chit-chat

where is your fathers place of business he travels for westhouse marbank the great claret importers of fenchurch street thank you,novel
i've never heard of that place. i'll have to check it out. do you know anything about it?,chit-chat
you have made your statement very clearly,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you saying that i've made my statement very clearly?,chit-chat
you will leave the papers here and remember the advice which i have given you,novel
"that's very kind of you to say, but i'm not sure i can do that.",chit-chat
let the whole incident be a sealed book and do not allow it to affect your life you are very kind mr holmes but i can not do that,novel
i don't think i'm going to let it affect my life. i think it's time for me to move on.,chit-chat
i shall be true to hosmer,novel
i'm sure you'll do great! what's your hosmer's name?,chit-chat
he shall find me ready when he comes back for all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face there was something noble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect,novel
that's so sweet of you. i'm sure you'll have a great time.,chit-chat
she laid her little bundle of papers upon the table and went her way with a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned,novel

"oh my god, that's so funny! i'm laughing so hard right now.",chit-chat
quite an interesting study that maiden he observed,novel
i'm not familiar with maiden. what's her name? i've never heard of her.,chit-chat
i found her more interesting than her little problem which by the way is rather a trite one,novel
what's her little problem? i've never heard of it. what is it?,chit-chat
you will find parallel cases if you consult my index in andover in 77 and there was something of the sort at the hague last year,novel
"wow, that's a long time ago. i'm sure you'll find something.",chit-chat
old as is the idea however there were one or two details which were new to me,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by old as is the idea however there were one or two details which were new to me.,chit-chat
but the maiden herself was most instructive you appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to me i remarked,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think about that. i'll have to make sure to do that next time.,chit-chat
not invisible but unnoticed watson,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'd rather be invisible than be invisible.",chit-chat
you did not know where to look and so you missed all that was important,novel
"i didn't know where to look, but i did miss a lot of important things.",chit-chat
i can never bring you to realise the importance of sleeves the suggestiveness of thumbnails or the great issues that may hang from a bootlace,novel
that's a good point. i'll have to keep that in mind for next time.,chit-chat
now what did you gather from that womans appearance,novel
"i thought it was a girl, but it was actually a boy. i was so shocked!",chit-chat
describe it well she had a slatecoloured broadbrimmed straw hat with a feather of a brickish red,novel
i don't think i've ever seen a straw hat with a feather of red.,chit-chat
her jacket was black with black beads sewn upon it and a fringe of little black jet ornaments,novel
"wow, that's pretty cool. i've never seen a jet ornament before.",chit-chat
her dress was brown rather darker than coffee colour with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never seen a dress like that before. what color was it?,chit-chat
her gloves were greyish and were worn through at the right forefinger,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad she didn't have to do that.,chit-chat
her boots i didnt observe,novel
i don't think i've ever seen her boots before. what did you observe?,chit-chat
she had small round hanging gold earrings and a general air of being fairly welltodo in a vulgar comfortable easygoing way sherlock holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled,novel
"wow, sherlock holmes! that's a great name for a sherlock holmes. have you heard of him?",chit-chat
pon my word watson you are coming along wonderfully,novel
pon my word watson you are coming along wonderfully wonderfully... what are you talking about?,chit-chat
you have really done very well indeed,novel
thank you so much! i'm so proud of myself for doing such a great job!,chit-chat
it is true that you have missed everything of importance but you have hit upon the method and you have a quick eye for colour,novel
"that's true, but i'm not sure if i'll be able to do it.",chit-chat
never trust to general impressions my boy but concentrate yourself upon details,novel
that's a good advice. i'm going to try my best to stay positive.,chit-chat
my first glance is always at a womans sleeve,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. why do you think it's always at a women's sleeve?,chit-chat
in a man it is perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure if i can do that though.,chit-chat
as you observe this woman had plush upon her sleeves which is a most useful material for showing traces,novel
"that's a good point, i didn't think of that. i'll have to look into that.",chit-chat
the double line a little above the wrist where the typewritist presses against the table was beautifully defined,novel
i love typewritist. it's one of my favorite things to do.,chit-chat
the sewingmachine of the hand type leaves a similar mark but only on the left arm and on the side of it farthest from the thumb instead of being right across the broadest part as this was,novel
"oh my god, i hate when that happens. how did you manage to clean it up?",chit-chat
i then glanced at her face and observing the dint of a pincenez at either side of her nose i ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting which seemed to surprise her it surprised me but surely it was obvious,novel
that's pretty funny. i'm sure she didn't think you were serious.,chit-chat
i was then much surprised and interested on glancing down to observe that though the boots which she was wearing were not unlike each other they were really odd ones the one having a slightly decorated toecap and the other a plain one,novel
that's interesting. i've never seen a toecap like that before. what kind of boots did she wear?,chit-chat
one was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five and the other at the first third and fifth,novel
"wow, that must have been a lot of work. did you find out who it was?",chit-chat
now when you see that a young lady otherwise neatly dressed has come away from home with odd boots halfbuttoned it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry and what else i asked keenly interested as i always was by my friends incisive reasoning,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
i noted in passing that she had written a note before leaving home but after being fully dressed,novel
that's not good. what did she say to you? did you say anything to her?,chit-chat
you observed that her right glove was torn at the forefinger but you did not apparently see that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think about that. i'll have to bring that up next time i see her.,chit-chat
she had written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep,novel
oh no! did you tell her that you didn't like the way she wrote it?,chit-chat
it must have been this morning or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger,novel
that's what i was thinking. i'm glad it wasn't my finger.,chit-chat
all this is amusing though rather elementary but i must go back to business watson,novel
what do you do for a living? i've always wanted to go back to business watson.,chit-chat
would you mind reading me the advertised description of mr hosmer angel i held the little printed slip to the light,novel
mr. hosmer angel is a fictional character from american horror story. he is a pretty cool guy.,chit-chat
missing it said on the morning of the fourteenth a gentleman named hosmer angel,novel
that's awesome! i'm sure you'll be able to find him soon.,chit-chat

"wow, that's a lot of people. do you have any other hobbies?",chit-chat

how tall are you? i'm 6 feet tall and i've never seen anyone taller than me.,chit-chat
was dressed when last seen in black frockcoat faced with silk black waistcoat gold albert chain and grey harris tweed trousers with brown gaiters over elasticsided boots,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. what did you do with the frockcoat and shoes?,chit-chat
known to have been employed in an office in leadenhall street,novel
"wow, that must have been a long time ago. did you have a good time working there?",chit-chat
anybody bringing c c that will do said holmes,novel
"i've never been to holmes, but i know it's a great place to visit.",chit-chat
as to the letters he continued glancing over them they are very commonplace,novel
i don't think i've ever gotten a letter from someone i didn't like.,chit-chat
absolutely no clue in them to mr angel save that he quotes balzac once,novel
"i've never heard of balzac, but i'll look it up. what's it about?",chit-chat
there is one remarkable point however which will no doubt strike you they are typewritten i remarked,novel
i'm not sure what you mean. what's the point you're trying to make?,chit-chat
not only that but the signature is typewritten,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never had a typewritten signature before.,chit-chat
look at the neat little hosmer angel at the bottom,novel
"i didn't see that at first, but now i can't unsee it!",chit-chat
there is a date you see but no superscription except leadenhall street which is rather vague,novel
that's too bad. i'd love to go to leadenhall street and see it.,chit-chat
the point about the signature is very suggestivein fact we may call it conclusive of what my dear fellow is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears upon the case i can not say that i do unless it were that he wished to be able to deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted no that was not the point,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure i've ever had to do that before.,chit-chat
however i shall write two letters which should settle the matter,novel
that's a good idea. i'm sure you'll get a lot of letters.,chit-chat
one is to a firm in the city the other is to the young ladys stepfather mr windibank asking him whether he could meet us here at six oclock tomorrow evening,novel
that's nice of mr windibank to ask. what do you do for a living?,chit-chat
it is just as well that we should do business with the male relatives,novel
that's a good idea. i don't think i've ever done that before.,chit-chat
and now doctor we can do nothing until the answers to those letters come so we may put our little problem upon the shelf for the interim i had had so many reasons to believe in my friends subtle powers of reasoning and extraordinary energy in action that i felt that he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which he treated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to fathom,novel
i'm so happy for you. i hope everything turns out well for you and your friend.,chit-chat
once only had i known him to fail in the case of the king of bohemia and of the irene adler photograph but when i looked back to the weird business of the sign of four and the extraordinary circumstances connected with the study in scarlet i felt that it would be a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i've never heard of irene adler. what's it about?,chit-chat
i left him then still puffing at his black clay pipe with the conviction that when i came again on the next evening i would find that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of miss mary sutherland,novel
"wow, that's pretty crazy. did you find out who it was or was it just a coincidence?",chit-chat
a professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the time and the whole of next day i was busy at the bedside of the sufferer,novel
that must have been quite a busy day. did you get to talk to the sufferer?,chit-chat
it was not until close upon six oclock that i found myself free and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to baker street half afraid that i might be too late to assist at the _dénouement_ of the little mystery,novel
that's awesome! i'm glad you found yourself free. what mystery was it?,chit-chat
i found sherlock holmes alone however half asleep with his long thin form curled up in the recesses of his armchair,novel
"wow, that's interesting. did you find out who he was before you found him?",chit-chat
a formidable array of bottles and testtubes with the pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid told me that he had spent his day in the chemical work which was so dear to him,novel
that's really sweet of him. i'm glad he was able to take care of you.,chit-chat
well have you solved it i asked as i entered,novel
i haven't yet. i'm still trying to figure out how to get it to work.,chit-chat
yes,novel
i love to go to the beach. it's a great place to relax and have a good time.,chit-chat
it was the bisulphate of baryta no no the mystery i cried,novel

oh that,novel
i can't believe it's been so long since i've seen that movie.,chit-chat
i thought of the salt that i have been working upon,novel
what kind of salt are you working on? i'm sure you'll do great!,chit-chat
there was never any mystery in the matter though as i said yesterday some of the details are of interest,novel
that's good to hear. it's always good to have something to look forward to.,chit-chat
the only drawback is that there is no law i fear that can touch the scoundrel who was he then and what was his object in deserting miss sutherland the question was hardly out of my mouth and holmes had not yet opened his lips to reply when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a tap at the door,novel
i'm sorry to hear that holmes had not yet opened his lips to respond when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a tap at the door.,chit-chat
this is the girls stepfather mr james windibank said holmes,novel
do you have a source for that? i'm not familiar with windibank's work.,chit-chat

i'm sorry to hear that. what do you mean by not quite your own master?,chit-chat
i am sorry that miss sutherland has troubled you about this little matter for i think it is far better not to wash linen of the sort in public,novel
"that's true, but i don't want to have to clean up after myself.",chit-chat
it was quite against my wishes that she came but she is a very excitable impulsive girl as you may have noticed and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind on a point,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did she do to make you feel that way?,chit-chat
of course i did not mind you so much as you are not connected with the official police but it is not pleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad,novel
i'm sorry you had to go through that. i hope you're doing better now.,chit-chat
besides it is a useless expense for how could you possibly find this hosmer angel on the contrary said holmes quietly i have every reason to believe that i will succeed in discovering mr hosmer angel mr windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find the angel.,chit-chat
i am delighted to hear it he said,novel
that's good to hear. i'm glad he's doing well for himself.,chit-chat
it is a curious thing remarked holmes that a typewriter has really quite as much individuality as a mans handwriting,novel
"i don't know much about typewriters, but i do know that some of them are very talented.",chit-chat
unless they are quite new no two of them write exactly alike,novel
"that's what i'm thinking, but i don't know if it's true.",chit-chat
some letters get more worn than others and some wear only on one side,novel
that's a good point. i'll have to look into that. do you have a favorite letter?,chit-chat
now you remark in this note of yours mr windibank that in every case there is some little slurring over of the e and a slight defect in the tail of the r there are fourteen other characteristics but those are the more obvious we do all our correspondence with this machine at the office and no doubt it is a little worn our visitor answered glancing keenly at holmes with his bright little eyes,novel
i'm not sure what you're talking about. i've never heard of holmes.,chit-chat
and now i will show you what is really a very interesting study mr windibank holmes continued,novel
i'm not familiar with mr windibank holmes. what's the study about?,chit-chat
i think of writing another little monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to crime,novel
that's interesting. what kind of monograph is it? i've never heard of a typewriter before.,chit-chat
it is a subject to which i have devoted some little attention,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're doing well in the class.,chit-chat
i have here four letters which purport to come from the missing man,novel
"wow, that's a lot of letters to purport to come from the missing man.",chit-chat
they are all typewritten,novel
"i'm not sure what typewritten means, but i know it's a typo.",chit-chat
in each case not only are the es slurred and the rs tailless but you will observe if you care to use my magnifying lens that the fourteen other characteristics to which i have alluded are there as well mr windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat,novel
i'm not familiar with mr windibank. what does he do for a living?,chit-chat
i can not waste time over this sort of fantastic talk mr holmes he said,novel
i'm glad you enjoyed it. what kind of talk was he talking about? i've never heard of him before.,chit-chat
if you can catch the man catch him and let me know when you have done it certainly said holmes stepping over and turning the key in the door,novel
that's a good idea. i'll let you know if i can catch him.,chit-chat
i let you know then that i have caught him what,novel
what did you catch him? i'm not sure what i'll do if i don't catch him.,chit-chat
where shouted mr windibank turning white to his lips and glancing about him like a rat in a trap,novel
what did mr windibank do to make you think he was a rat in a trap?,chit-chat
oh it wont doreally it wont said holmes suavely,novel
that's what i'm worried about. i don't know what to do.,chit-chat
there is no possible getting out of it mr windibank,novel
that's what i'm afraid of. i don't know what to do.,chit-chat
it is quite too transparent and it was a very bad compliment when you said that it was impossible for me to solve so simple a question,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i didn't mean to come off that way.,chit-chat
thats right,novel
it's been a long time since i've been able to go to the beach.,chit-chat
sit down and let us talk it over our visitor collapsed into a chair with a ghastly face and a glitter of moisture on his brow,novel
"oh my god, i hate when that happens. what did you say to him about it?",chit-chat
itits not actionable he stammered,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you referring to the fact that he doesn't know what he's doing?,chit-chat
i am very much afraid that it is not,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what's going on in your life right now?,chit-chat
but between ourselves windibank it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty way as ever came before me,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do to make you feel that way?,chit-chat
now let me just run over the course of events and you will contradict me if i go wrong the man sat huddled up in his chair with his head sunk upon his breast like one who is utterly crushed,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay. what happened to him?,chit-chat
holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of the mantelpiece and leaning back with his hands in his pockets began talking rather to himself as it seemed than to us,novel
"hello, holmes. how are you doing today? i hope you are having a good day.",chit-chat
the man married a woman very much older than himself for her money said he and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long as she lived with them,novel
that's very nice of him. i'm sure he was very proud of her.,chit-chat
it was a considerable sum for people in their position and the loss of it would have made a serious difference,novel
"yes, it would have made a huge difference. i'm so happy for you and your family.",chit-chat
it was worth an effort to preserve it,novel
"yes, it was. i'm so proud of him for doing such a good thing.",chit-chat
the daughter was of a good amiable disposition but affectionate and warmhearted in her ways so that it was evident that with her fair personal advantages and her little income she would not be allowed to remain single long,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she's doing better now than she used to be.,chit-chat
now her marriage would mean of course the loss of a hundred a year so what does her stepfather do to prevent it,novel
that's a good question. i don't know. i'm not sure what to do.,chit-chat
he takes the obvious course of keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of people of her own age,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm not sure i could do that.,chit-chat
but soon he found that that would not answer forever,novel
that's what i was thinking. i'm not sure what to do with myself.,chit-chat
she became restive insisted upon her rights and finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain ball,novel
that's awesome! what ball was she going to go to? was it a big one?,chit-chat
what does her clever stepfather do then,novel
i don't know. i'm not sure if he's a good stepfather or not.,chit-chat
he conceives an idea more creditable to his head than to his heart,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm not sure i've ever felt that way before.,chit-chat
with the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses masked the face with a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers sunk that clear voice into an insinuating whisper and doubly secure on account of the girls short sight he appears as mr hosmer angel and keeps off other lovers by making love himself it was only a joke at first groaned our visitor,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i'm not sure if i've ever seen a mr. hosmer angel before.",chit-chat
we never thought that she would have been so carried away very likely not,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she's doing better now. what happened?,chit-chat
however that may be the young lady was very decidedly carried away and having quite made up her mind that her stepfather was in france the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of treachery before. what does it entail?,chit-chat
she was flattered by the gentlemans attentions and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother,novel
that's really sweet of her. i'm sure she's proud of you.,chit-chat
then mr angel began to call for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a real effect were to be produced,novel
that's a good way to look at it. do you think it's true?,chit-chat
there were meetings and an engagement which would finally secure the girls affections from turning towards anyone else,novel
that's great! i'm glad it worked out for you. how long have you been together?,chit-chat
but the deception could not be kept up forever,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure if i could keep it up.,chit-chat
these pretended journeys to france were rather cumbrous,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did they do to make you feel that way?,chit-chat
the thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the young ladys mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to come,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm not sure i could do that.,chit-chat
hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a testament and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening on the very morning of the wedding,novel
that makes a lot of sense. i didn't think of it that way. thank you.,chit-chat
james windibank wished miss sutherland to be so bound to hosmer angel and so uncertain as to his fate that for ten years to come at any rate she would not listen to another man,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. have you heard of james windibank's work?,chit-chat
as far as the church door he brought her and then as he could go no farther he conveniently vanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a fourwheeler and out at the other,novel
that's interesting. did you find out who he was? did you confront him about it?,chit-chat
i think that was the chain of events mr windibank our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while holmes had been talking and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his pale face,novel
that's really interesting. did you find out who he was or what he was up to?,chit-chat
it may be so or it may not mr holmes said he but if you are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are breaking the law now and not me,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'll have to think about that.,chit-chat
i have done nothing actionable from the first but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal constraint the law can not as you say touch you said holmes unlocking and throwing open the door yet there never was a man who deserved punishment more,novel
that's a good point. i'll keep that in mind. thank you for the advice.,chit-chat
if the young lady has a brother or a friend he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders,novel
that's a good idea. i'll have to do that next time i see her.,chit-chat
by jove he continued flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the mans face it is not part of my duties to my client but heres a hunting crop handy and i think i shall just treat myself to he took two swift steps to the whip but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs the heavy hall door banged and from the window we could see mr james windibank running at the top of his speed down the road,novel
"wow, that's intense! i'm glad you're okay. what did you do?",chit-chat
theres a coldblooded scoundrel said holmes laughing as he threw himself down into his chair once more,novel
that's pretty funny. i'm not sure i'd be able to laugh that hard.,chit-chat
that fellow will rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad and ends on a gallows,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you referring to someone who has done something bad?,chit-chat
the case has in some respects been not entirely devoid of interest i can not now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning i remarked,novel
i don't know what i'm going to do. i can't even think about it.,chit-chat
well of course it was obvious from the first that this mr hosmer angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct and it was equally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident as far as we could see was the stepfather,novel
i don't think i've ever seen a mr. hosmer angel before.,chit-chat
then the fact that the two men were never together but that the one always appeared when the other was away was suggestive,novel
"oh no, i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're doing better now.",chit-chat
so were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice which both hinted at a disguise as did the bushy whiskers,novel
i don't think i've ever seen the curious voice. i'll have to look it up.,chit-chat
my suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his signature which of course inferred that his handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even the smallest sample of it,novel
"wow, that's interesting. did you find out who he was or what he did?",chit-chat
you see all these isolated facts together with many minor ones all pointed in the same direction and how did you verify them having once spotted my man it was easy to get corroboration,novel
i don't know. i'm not sure. i guess i'll have to find out.,chit-chat
i knew the firm for which this man worked,novel
"that's pretty cool. what kind of firm did he work for, if you don't mind me asking?",chit-chat
having taken the printed description,novel
i love taking the printed description. it makes me feel like i'm doing something right.,chit-chat
i eliminated everything from it which could be the result of a disguisethe whiskers the glasses the voice and i sent it to the firm with a request that they would inform me whether it answered to the description of any of their travellers,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never heard of a disguisethe whiskers before.,chit-chat
i had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter and i wrote to the man himself at his business address asking him if he would come here,novel
that's really nice of you to do that. i'm sure he appreciated it.,chit-chat
as i expected his reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but characteristic defects,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
the same post brought me a letter from westhouse marbank of fenchurch street to say that the description tallied in every respect with that of their employé james windibank,novel
"wow, that's really cool. i've never heard of him before. what did you write to him about?",chit-chat
_voilà tout_ and miss sutherland if i tell her she will not believe me,novel
"i've never heard of miss sutherland, what's it about? i'm not familiar with miss sutherland.",chit-chat
you may remember the old persian saying there is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman there is as much sense in hafiz as in horace and as much knowledge of the world iv,novel
"i don't know much about hafiz, but i do know that it is the oldest religion in the world.",chit-chat

"i've never seen that movie, but i'm sure it's a good one.",chit-chat
will you go i really dont know what to say,novel
i don't think so. i'm not sure if i want to go or not.,chit-chat
i have a fairly long list at present oh anstruther would do your work for you,novel
i've never heard of them. i'll have to check them out. what kind of work do you do?,chit-chat
you have been looking a little pale lately,novel
"yeah, i've been pretty pale lately. i'm trying to get used to it.",chit-chat
i think that the change would do you good and you are always so interested in mr sherlock holmes cases i should be ungrateful if i were not seeing what i gained through one of them i answered,novel
that's a great way to look at it. i think i'll do the same.,chit-chat
but if i am to go i must pack at once for i have only half an hour my experience of camp life in afghanistan had at least had the effect of making me a prompt and ready traveller,novel
"i'm sorry to hear that. i've never been in the military, so i don't know much about it.",chit-chat
my wants were few and simple so that in less than the time stated i was in a cab with my valise rattling away to paddington station,novel
"oh wow, that must have been scary. i hope you were able to get home safely.",chit-chat
sherlock holmes was pacing up and down the platform his tall gaunt figure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey travellingcloak and closefitting cloth cap,novel
sherlock holmes is one of my favorite sherlock holmes novels. it's one of the best novels i've ever read.,chit-chat
it is really very good of you to come watson said he,novel
thank you! i'm so proud of him. he's such a great person.,chit-chat
it makes a considerable difference to me having someone with me on whom i can thoroughly rely,novel
that's good to hear. it's always good to have someone you can rely on.,chit-chat
local aid is always either worthless or else biassed,novel
that's what i'm thinking. i don't know what to do with myself.,chit-chat
if you will keep the two corner seats i shall get the tickets we had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers which holmes had brought with him,novel
that's a good idea. i'm sure holmes will be happy to help you out.,chit-chat
among these he rummaged and read with intervals of notetaking and of meditation until we were past reading,novel
that's interesting. did you find out who he was or what he was up to?,chit-chat
then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack,novel
that's what i was thinking. i'm glad he didn't do it again.,chit-chat
have you heard anything of the case he asked,novel
i haven't heard anything yet. i'm not sure what to expect from him.,chit-chat
not a word,novel
i'm not sure what you mean. are you referring to a word that isn't a word?,chit-chat
i have not seen a paper for some days the london press has not had very full accounts,novel
i've never seen a paper for some days the london press has not had very full accounts.,chit-chat
i have just been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the particulars,novel
i'm sure you'll do great! what kind of papers are you looking for?,chit-chat
it seems from what i gather to be one of those simple cases which are so extremely difficult that sounds a little paradoxical but it is profoundly true,novel
that's true. it's hard to believe that some people are just born with it.,chit-chat
singularity is almost invariably a clue,novel
"i've never heard of singularity before, but it sounds interesting. what's it about?",chit-chat
the more featureless and commonplace a crime is the more difficult it is to bring it home,novel
"that's true, but i'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing.",chit-chat
in this case however they have established a very serious case against the son of the murdered man it is a murder then well it is conjectured to be so,novel
i don't think i've ever heard of a murder being conjectured.,chit-chat
i shall take nothing for granted until i have the opportunity of looking personally into it,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm sure you'll do great.,chit-chat
i will explain the state of things to you as far as i have been able to understand it in a very few words,novel
that would be great. what is it that you have been able to understand in a very few words?,chit-chat
boscombe valley is a country district not very far from ross in herefordshire,novel
have you ever been to boscombe valley? it's a great place to visit.,chit-chat
the largest landed proprietor in that part is a mr john turner who made his money in australia and returned some years ago to the old country,novel
that's really cool. i've never heard of a mr john turner before. what's his name?,chit-chat
one of the farms which he held that of hatherley was let to mr charles mccarthy who was also an exaustralian,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. i've never heard of that farm before. what's the name of the farm?",chit-chat
the men had known each other in the colonies so that it was not unnatural that when they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as possible,novel
that makes a lot of sense. i didn't know that. thank you for the information.,chit-chat
turner was apparently the richer man so mccarthy became his tenant but still remained it seems upon terms of perfect equality as they were frequently together,novel
that's interesting. i didn't know that. do you have a source for that?,chit-chat
mccarthy had one son a lad of eighteen and turner had an only daughter of the same age but neither of them had wives living,novel
that's sad. i'm sorry to hear that. it must have been hard for them.,chit-chat
they appear to have avoided the society of the neighbouring english families and to have led retired lives though both the mccarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the racemeetings of the neighbourhood,novel
that's interesting. i didn't know that. do you have a source for that?,chit-chat
mccarthy kept two servantsa man and a girl,novel
"wow, that's impressive. i've never heard of a servantsa man before.",chit-chat
turner had a considerable household some halfdozen at the least,novel
i'm not familiar with turner. what's it about him you're talking about?,chit-chat
that is as much as i have been able to gather about the families,novel
it's been a long time since i've had to deal with anything like that.,chit-chat
now for the facts,novel
what facts do you want to know? i'm not sure what you're talking about.,chit-chat
on june 3rd that is on monday last mccarthy left his house at hatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the boscombe pool which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream which runs down the boscombe valley,novel
i've never been to the boscombe pool. what's it like there?,chit-chat
he had been out with his servingman in the morning at ross and he had told the man that he must hurry as he had an appointment of importance to keep at three,novel
that must have been very stressful for him. what did he say to the servingman?,chit-chat
from that appointment he never came back alive,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find him soon.,chit-chat
from hatherley farmhouse to the boscombe pool is a quarter of a mile and two people saw him as he passed over this ground,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope he was able to recover from it.,chit-chat
one was an old woman whose name is not mentioned and the other was william crowder a gamekeeper in the employ of mr turner,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. i didn't know crowder was a gamekeeper.",chit-chat
both these witnesses depose that mr mccarthy was walking alone,novel
i've never heard of mr mccarthy. what does he do for a living? is he a lawyer?,chit-chat
the gamekeeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing mr mccarthy pass he had seen his son mr james mccarthy going the same way with a gun under his arm,novel
"wow, that's crazy. i'm glad he didn't have to do that.",chit-chat
to the best of his belief the father was actually in sight at the time and the son was following him,novel
that's really interesting. what did he do to make you think he was following you?,chit-chat
he thought no more of the matter until he heard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope he's doing better now. what happened?,chit-chat
the two mccarthys were seen after the time when william crowder the gamekeeper lost sight of them,novel
that's really cool. i've never heard of crowder before. what's his name?,chit-chat
the boscombe pool is thickly wooded round with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. have you ever been to the boscombe pool?,chit-chat
a girl of fourteen patience moran who is the daughter of the lodgekeeper of the boscombe valley estate was in one of the woods picking flowers,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. i've never heard of a lodgekeeper before.",chit-chat
she states that while she was there she saw at the border of the wood and close by the lake mr mccarthy and his son and that they appeared to be having a violent quarrel,novel
"wow, that's crazy. i'm glad they didn't do anything bad.",chit-chat
she heard mr mccarthy the elder using very strong language to his son and she saw the latter raise up his hand as if to strike his father,novel
that's really sweet of him. i'm sure he's a great parent.,chit-chat
she was so frightened by their violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home that she had left the two mccarthys quarrelling near boscombe pool and that she was afraid that they were going to fight,novel
"wow, that's scary. i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she's okay.",chit-chat
she had hardly said the words when young mr mccarthy came running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead in the wood and to ask for the help of the lodgekeeper,novel
that's so sad. i'm sorry to hear that. did you find out who he was?,chit-chat
he was much excited without either his gun or his hat and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood,novel
that's pretty cool. did you get to see him in person or at the store?,chit-chat
on following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the grass beside the pool,novel
oh no! that's terrible. i hope he's okay. i'm so sorry.,chit-chat
the head had been beaten in by repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon,novel
"oh no, that's terrible. i'm sorry to hear that. what happened?",chit-chat
the injuries were such as might very well have been inflicted by the buttend of his sons gun which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body,novel
that's terrible. i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope he's okay.,chit-chat
under these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested and a verdict of wilful murder having been returned at the inquest on tuesday he was on wednesday brought before the magistrates at ross who have referred the case to the next assizes,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope he's in a better place now.,chit-chat
those are the main facts of the case as they came out before the coroner and the policecourt i could hardly imagine a more damning case i remarked,novel
i can't imagine what it must have been like for you to have to go through that.,chit-chat
if ever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing answered holmes thoughtfully,novel
i'm not sure what you mean. are you talking about circumstantial evidence?,chit-chat
it may seem to point very straight to one thing but if you shift your own point of view a little you may find it pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i think i'm going to do that.,chit-chat
it must be confessed however that the case looks exceedingly grave against the young man and it is very possible that he is indeed the culprit,novel
"i don't think he is the culprit, but i do believe he is guilty.",chit-chat
there are several people in the neighbourhood however and among them miss turner the daughter of the neighbouring landowner who believe in his innocence and who have retained lestrade whom you may recollect in connection with the study in scarlet to work out the case in his interest,novel
that's interesting. i'm not familiar with scarlet's case. what's her name?,chit-chat
lestrade being rather puzzled has referred the case to me and hence it is that two middleaged gentlemen are flying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting their breakfasts at home i am afraid said i that the facts are so obvious that you will find little credit to be gained out of this case there is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact he answered laughing,novel
that's interesting. i'm not familiar with lestrade. what's it about?,chit-chat
besides we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to mr lestrade,novel
i've never heard of mr lestrade. what's his name? i'm not familiar with him.,chit-chat
you know me too well to think that i am boasting when i say that i shall either confirm or destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of employing or even of understanding,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to work it out.,chit-chat
to take the first example to hand i very clearly perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the righthand side and yet i question whether mr lestrade would have noted even so selfevident a thing as that how on earth my dear fellow i know you well,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you referring to the fact that the window is on the other side of the room?,chit-chat
i know the military neatness which characterises you,novel
i'm not sure what you mean. are you talking about the military neatness?,chit-chat
you shave every morning and in this season you shave by the sunlight but since your shaving is less and less complete as we get farther back on the left side until it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated than the other,novel
that makes a lot of sense. i didn't know that. thank you for that information.,chit-chat
i could not imagine a man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a result,novel
i'm not sure i could do it. it's hard for me to get motivated.,chit-chat
i only quote this as a trivial example of observation and inference,novel
that's a good example of observation and inference. do you have a favorite example?,chit-chat
therein lies my _métier_ and it is just possible that it may be of some service in the investigation which lies before us,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm sure it's true.,chit-chat
there are one or two minor points which were brought out in the inquest and which are worth considering what are they it appears that his arrest did not take place at once but after the return to hatherley farm,novel
i didn't know that. that's interesting. i'm not familiar with hatherley farm.,chit-chat
on the inspector of constabulary informing him that he was a prisoner he remarked that he was not surprised to hear it and that it was no more than his deserts,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad he was able to get away with it.,chit-chat
this observation of his had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the coroners jury it was a confession i ejaculated,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you saying that he was guilty?,chit-chat
no for it was followed by a protestation of innocence coming on the top of such a damning series of events it was at least a most suspicious remark on the contrary said holmes it is the brightest rift which i can at present see in the clouds,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of a bririft before. what's it like?,chit-chat
however innocent he might be he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances were very black against him,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure if he's innocent or not.,chit-chat
had he appeared surprised at his own arrest or feigned indignation at it i should have looked upon it as highly suspicious because such surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man,novel
that's a good way to look at it. it's always good to look on the bright side.,chit-chat
his frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent man or else as a man of considerable selfrestraint and firmness,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i don't think i've ever felt that way before.,chit-chat
as to his remark about his deserts it was also not unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his father and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him and even according to the little girl whose evidence is so important to raise his hand as if to strike him,novel
"i don't know about you, but i've never heard of a little girl raising her hand as if to strike him.",chit-chat
the selfreproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a guilty one i shook my head,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i don't think i've ever felt that way before.,chit-chat
many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence i remarked,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you referring to men who have been hung?,chit-chat
so they have,novel
"yes, they have. it's been a long time since i've seen them.",chit-chat
and many men have been wrongfully hanged what is the young mans own account of the matter it is i am afraid not very encouraging to his supporters though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get through it.,chit-chat
you will find it here and may read it for yourself he picked out from his bundle a copy of the local herefordshire paper and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had occurred,novel
that's interesting. i've never read the herefordshire paper before. have you?,chit-chat
i settled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read it very carefully,novel
oh no! i hope you were able to get out of the carriage and get back in the car!,chit-chat
it ran in this way mr,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you saying that it ran in the way mr.?,chit-chat
james mccarthy the only son of the deceased was then called and gave evidence as follows i had been away from home for three days at bristol and had only just returned upon the morning of last monday the 3rd,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you were able to find him soon.,chit-chat
my father was absent from home at the time of my arrival and i was informed by the maid that he had driven over to ross with john cobb the groom,novel
that's really sweet of your father to do that to you. i'm so sorry to hear that.,chit-chat
shortly after my return i heard the wheels of his trap in the yard and looking out of my window i saw him get out and walk rapidly out of the yard though i was not aware in which direction he was going,novel
that must have been scary! did you find out where he was? did you call the police?,chit-chat
i then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of the boscombe pool with the intention of visiting the rabbit warren which is upon the other side,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. did you get to see the rabbit in the pool?,chit-chat
on my way i saw william crowder the gamekeeper as he had stated in his evidence but he is mistaken in thinking that i was following my father,novel
"wow, that's interesting. did you see him at all? did you find out who he was?",chit-chat
i had no idea that he was in front of me,novel
why did you think he was in front of you? did you not know he was there?,chit-chat
when about a hundred yards from the pool i heard a cry of cooee which was a usual signal between my father and myself,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never heard of a cry of cooee before.,chit-chat
i then hurried forward and found him standing by the pool,novel
oh no! what did you do? did you tell him to get out of the pool?,chit-chat
he appeared to be much surprised at seeing me and asked me rather roughly what i was doing there,novel
that's nice of him. what did you do to make him think you were there?,chit-chat
a conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows for my father was a man of a very violent temper,novel
oh no! i'm sorry to hear that. what did you say to him about it?,chit-chat
seeing that his passion was becoming ungovernable i left him and returned towards hatherley farm,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
i had not gone more than 150 yards however when i heard a hideous outcry behind me which caused me to run back again,novel
oh no! i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay now.,chit-chat
i found my father expiring upon the ground with his head terribly injured,novel
oh no! i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope he's okay.,chit-chat
i dropped my gun and held him in my arms but he almost instantly expired,novel
oh no! that's so scary! i hope he didn't get hurt too bad.,chit-chat
i knelt beside him for some minutes and then made my way to mr turners lodgekeeper his house being the nearest to ask for assistance,novel
that's really nice of you. i'm glad you were able to help him.,chit-chat
i saw no one near my father when i returned and i have no idea how he came by his injuries,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope he's okay. what happened?,chit-chat
he was not a popular man being somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners but he had as far as i know no active enemies,novel
that's good to know. i'm glad he wasn't a popular man.,chit-chat
i know nothing further of the matter the coroner did your father make any statement to you before he died,novel
"he didn't say anything, but i'm not sure what he meant by that.",chit-chat
witness he mumbled a few words but i could only catch some allusion to a rat,novel
i don't think i've ever heard of a rat before. what did he say?,chit-chat
the coroner what did you understand by that,novel
i don't know what you mean by that. i'm not sure what you're talking about.,chit-chat
witness it conveyed no meaning to me,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what do you mean by it conveying no meaning to you?,chit-chat
i thought that he was delirious,novel
why did you think he was delirious? what did he do to make you think that?,chit-chat
the coroner what was the point upon which you and your father had this final quarrel,novel
"we had a good time. it was a long time ago, but i still miss him.",chit-chat
witness i should prefer not to answer,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. do you have a reason why you feel that way?,chit-chat
the coroner i am afraid that i must press it,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. why do you think that's a good idea?,chit-chat
witness it is really impossible for me to tell you,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what do you mean by it being impossible for you to tell you?,chit-chat
i can assure you that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed,novel
i don't know... i think it's a little bit of both.,chit-chat
the coroner that is for the court to decide,novel
"i'm not sure what that means, but i hope it's for the right reasons.",chit-chat
i need not point out to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably in any future proceedings which may arise,novel
i don't think so. i just want to make sure i'm getting what i want.,chit-chat
witness i must still refuse,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. do you have a reason for not being able to see them?,chit-chat
the coroner i understand that the cry of cooee was a common signal between you and your father,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think of it that way. it's been a long time since we've been together.,chit-chat
witness it was,novel
"have you ever been witness to a crime? i've never been, but i'd like to learn more about it.",chit-chat
the coroner how was it then that he uttered it before he saw you and before he even knew that you had returned from bristol,novel
that's what i'm thinking too. it's like he didn't even see me.,chit-chat
witness with considerable confusion i do not know,novel
"i'm sorry to hear that. what do you mean by "" witness with considerable confusion ""?",chit-chat
a juryman did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you returned on hearing the cry and found your father fatally injured,novel
"wow, that's scary! i'm sorry to hear that. what happened to your father?",chit-chat
witness nothing definite,novel
have you ever heard of witness witness? it's a recording of a witness's identity.,chit-chat
the coroner what do you mean,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that... what do you mean exactly?,chit-chat
witness i was so disturbed and excited as i rushed out into the open that i could think of nothing except of my father,novel
that must have been so exciting! what did you think of your father when you saw him?,chit-chat
yet i have a vague impression that as i ran forward something lay upon the ground to the left of me,novel
oh no! what did you think it was? was it a dog or a cat or something?,chit-chat
it seemed to me to be something grey in colour a coat of some sort or a plaid perhaps,novel
"i don't think it's a plaid, but i'm not sure what color it is.",chit-chat
when i rose from my father i looked round for it but it was gone,novel
"oh no, i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find it.",chit-chat
do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help yes it was gone you can not say what it was no i had a feeling something was there how far from the body a dozen yards or so and how far from the edge of the wood about the same then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of it yes but with my back towards it this concluded the examination of the witness i see said i as i glanced down the column that the coroner in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young mccarthy,novel
"yes, it disappeared before i went for help. i had a feeling something was there how far away from the body a dozen yards or so and how far from the edge of the wood about the same then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozens yards of it yes but with my back towards it this concluded the examination of the witness i see said i as i glance down the column that the coroner in his conclude remarks was rather severe upon young mccarthy",chit-chat
he calls attention and with reason to the discrepancy about his father having signalled to him before seeing him also to his refusal to give details of his conversation with his father and his singular account of his fathers dying words,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i've never heard of that before. what happened?",chit-chat
they are all as he remarks very much against the son holmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the cushioned seat,novel
that's pretty funny. i've never heard of holmes before. what's his name?,chit-chat
both you and the coroner have been at some pains said he to single out the very strongest points in the young mans favour,novel
that's good to hear. it's always nice to have someone to talk to.,chit-chat
dont you see that you alternately give him credit for having too much imagination and too little,novel
i don't see it that way at all. i'm not sure what you mean.,chit-chat
too little if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury too much if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so _outré_ as a dying reference to a rat and the incident of the vanishing cloth,novel
i've never heard of the vanishing cloth incident. what's that reference about?,chit-chat
no sir i shall approach this case from the point of view that what this young man says is true and we shall see whither that hypothesis will lead us,novel
that's a good attitude to have. i'm sure you'll have a great time.,chit-chat
and now here is my pocket petrarch and not another word shall i say of this case until we are on the scene of action,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get it fixed.,chit-chat
we lunch at swindon and i see that we shall be there in twenty minutes it was nearly four oclock when we at last after passing through the beautiful stroud valley and over the broad gleaming severn found ourselves at the pretty little countrytown of ross,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. did you have a good time at the end of the day?,chit-chat
a lean ferretlike man furtive and slylooking was waiting for us upon the platform,novel
that's pretty cool. did you get out of the car and get to the platform?,chit-chat
in spite of the light brown dustcoat and leatherleggings which he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings i had no difficulty in recognising lestrade of scotland yard,novel
i've never heard of lestrade of scotland yard. what does it look like?,chit-chat
with him we drove to the hereford arms where a room had already been engaged for us,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. how long did it take for you to get engaged?,chit-chat
i have ordered a carriage said lestrade as we sat over a cup of tea,novel
"wow, that's a lot of tea! what did you end up getting? did you enjoy it?",chit-chat
i knew your energetic nature and that you would not be happy until you had been on the scene of the crime it was very nice and complimentary of you holmes answered,novel
i'm glad you were able to escape the crime. i hope you're doing better now.,chit-chat
it is entirely a question of barometric pressure lestrade looked startled,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think of that. i'll have to think about that.,chit-chat
i do not quite follow he said,novel
"he told me that he was going to marry me, but i didn't want to.",chit-chat
how is the glass,novel
it's pretty good. i've had it for about a year and a half.,chit-chat
twentynine i see,novel
"yes, i've seen him a few times. he's a pretty cool guy.",chit-chat
no wind and not a cloud in the sky,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. do you live in a place with a lot of rain?,chit-chat
i have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find a way to quit.,chit-chat
i do not think that it is probable that i shall use the carriage tonight lestrade laughed indulgently,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to use the carriage.,chit-chat
you have no doubt already formed your conclusions from the newspapers he said,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. what newspapers did he say about him?,chit-chat
the case is as plain as a pikestaff and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes,novel
that's a good way to look at it. do you think it's worth it?,chit-chat
still of course one cant refuse a lady and such a very positive one too,novel
that's true. i'm happy for her. she's a good person.,chit-chat
she has heard of you and would have your opinion though i repeatedly told her that there was nothing which you could do which i had not already done,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm sure she'll understand.,chit-chat
why bless my soul,novel
that's nice of you to say. what do you do for a living? do you have any hobbies?,chit-chat
here is her carriage at the door he had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most lovely young women that i have ever seen in my life,novel
that's really sweet of him. i'm sure he was very happy for you.,chit-chat
her violet eyes shining her lips parted a pink flush upon her cheeks all thought of her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern,novel
"hey there, how are you? i just got back from the beach and i'm having a great time.",chit-chat
oh mr sherlock holmes she cried glancing from one to the other of us and finally with a womans quick intuition fastening upon my companion i am so glad that you have come,novel
that's so sweet! i'm so happy for you. i hope she's doing well.,chit-chat
i have driven down to tell you so,novel
what did you drive down to tell you? i'm not sure what you mean by that.,chit-chat
i know that james didnt do it,novel
james diddon't do it? what does he do? i've never heard of him.,chit-chat
i know it and i want you to start upon your work knowing it too,novel
i've been working on it for a long time. i just don't know what to do anymore.,chit-chat
never let yourself doubt upon that point,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm sure i'll be fine.,chit-chat
we have known each other since we were little children and i know his faults as no one else does but he is too tenderhearted to hurt a fly,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. how long have you known each other since you were little children?,chit-chat
such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him i hope we may clear him miss turner said sherlock holmes,novel
"i hope so too. i don't know who he is, but i hope he rots in prison.",chit-chat
you may rely upon my doing all that i can but you have read the evidence,novel
"i've read the evidence, but i'm not sure if it's true or not.",chit-chat
you have formed some conclusion,novel
i'm not sure what you mean. what conclusion do you think i've formed?,chit-chat
do you not see some loophole some flaw,novel
i don't see any loophole. i'm not sure what you mean.,chit-chat
do you not yourself think that he is innocent i think that it is very probable there now she cried throwing back her head and looking defiantly at lestrade,novel
"i don't think he's innocent, but i do think that he is guilty.",chit-chat
you hear,novel
i don't know what i'm going to do with the money i've made.,chit-chat
he gives me hopes lestrade shrugged his shoulders,novel
"i don't know who that's, but i'm sure it's not lestrade.",chit-chat
i am afraid that my colleague has been a little quick in forming his conclusions he said,novel
oh no! what did he say about it? is it something you're worried about?,chit-chat
but he is right,novel
"he is right, but he is also wrong about a lot of things. it's sad.",chit-chat
oh,novel
do you have any pets? i have a dog and a cat. they are so cute.,chit-chat
i know that he is right,novel
"i'm not sure if he's right or wrong, but i don't like him either.",chit-chat
james never did it,novel
james is such a great player. he is one of the best in the history of the game.,chit-chat
and about his quarrel with his father i am sure that the reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because i was concerned in it in what way asked holmes,novel
that's a good reason to be concerned. i'm glad he didn't.,chit-chat
it is no time for me to hide anything,novel
that's a shame. i'm sorry to hear that. do you have any hobbies?,chit-chat
james and his father had many disagreements about me,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did your father do to make you feel that way?,chit-chat
mr mccarthy was very anxious that there should be a marriage between us,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get through it.,chit-chat
james and i have always loved each other as brother and sister but of course he is young and has seen very little of life yet andandwell he naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet,novel
that's really sweet of him. i'm sure he's a great person.,chit-chat
so there were quarrels and this i am sure was one of them and your father asked holmes,novel
"i don't know about holmes, but i do know that i've never seen one in my life.",chit-chat
was he in favour of such a union no he was averse to it also,novel
i don't think he was averse to it. he just didn't like it.,chit-chat
no one but mr mccarthy was in favour of it a quick blush passed over her fresh young face as holmes shot one of his keen questioning glances at her,novel
i'm not familiar with mr. mccarthy. what's he up to these days?,chit-chat
thank you for this information said he,novel
you're welcome. i'm glad i could help. i hope you have a great day!,chit-chat
may i see your father if i call tomorrow i am afraid the doctor wont allow it the doctor yes have you not heard,novel
"i've heard, but i don't know if i'll be able to see him tomorrow.",chit-chat
poor father has never been strong for years back but this has broken him down completely,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope he's able to get back on his feet soon.,chit-chat
he has taken to his bed and dr willows says that he is a wreck and that his nervous system is shattered,novel
"oh no, i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope he's okay.",chit-chat
mr mccarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the old days in victoria ha,novel
"i've never heard of him, but i'm familiar with him. what's he like?",chit-chat
in victoria,novel
have you ever been to victoria? it's the capital and most populous city of victoria.,chit-chat
that is important yes at the mines quite so at the goldmines where as i understand mr turner made his money yes certainly thank you miss turner,novel
"yes, mr. turner has made a lot of money. he's been around for a long time.",chit-chat
you have been of material assistance to me you will tell me if you have any news tomorrow,novel
"i will, thank you so much. i really appreciate it. i hope you have a great day!",chit-chat
no doubt you will go to the prison to see james,novel
"i hope so. i've never been to prison, but i'd love to see him.",chit-chat
oh if you do mr holmes do tell him that i know him to be innocent i will miss turner i must go home now for dad is very ill and he misses me so if i leave him,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to take care of him.,chit-chat
goodbye and god help you in your undertaking she hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered and we heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope she's okay. what did you do?,chit-chat
i am ashamed of you holmes said lestrade with dignity after a few minutes silence,novel
i am ashamed of you holmes said lestrade with dignity after a couple minutes silence after a few minutes silence,chit-chat
why should you raise up hopes which you are bound to disappoint,novel
i don't know. i'm not sure. i guess i'll just have to wait and see.,chit-chat
i am not overtender of heart but i call it cruel i think that i see my way to clearing james mccarthy said holmes,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to do something about it.,chit-chat
have you an order to see him in prison yes but only for you and me then i shall reconsider my resolution about going out,novel
i don't think he's going to be in prison. i'm sure he'll be fine.,chit-chat
we have still time to take a train to hereford and see him tonight ample then let us do so,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. i'm sure you'll have a great time.,chit-chat
watson i fear that you will find it very slow but i shall only be away a couple of hours i walked down to the station with them and then wandered through the streets of the little town finally returning to the hotel where i lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellowbacked novel,novel
"i've never heard of watson, but it sounds interesting. what kind of novel was it?",chit-chat
the puny plot of the story was so thin however when compared to the deep mystery through which we were groping and i found my attention wander so continually from the action to the fact that i at last flung it across the room and gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the day,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. did you find out who did it or what happened?,chit-chat
supposing that this unhappy young mans story were absolutely true then what hellish thing what absolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the time when he parted from his father and the moment when drawn back by his screams he rushed into the glade,novel
i'm so sorry to hear about that. i hope you're doing better now.,chit-chat
it was something terrible and deadly,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're ok. what did you do?,chit-chat
what could it be,novel
i don't know. i'm not sure. it's been a while since i've seen it.,chit-chat
might not the nature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope it's not something you're worried about.,chit-chat
i rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper which contained a verbatim account of the inquest,novel
that's great! i'm sure you'll get a lot of good news.,chit-chat
in the surgeons deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon,novel
that's terrible. i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay.,chit-chat
i marked the spot upon my own head,novel
that's a good thing to do. i've done that a few times myself.,chit-chat
clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind,novel
"yes, it was. i was so mad at myself for not paying attention to what i was doing.",chit-chat
that was to some extent in favour of the accused as when seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father,novel
that's so sad. i'm glad he didn't have to go through that.,chit-chat
still it did not go for very much for the older man might have turned his back before the blow fell,novel
that's what i was thinking. i'm glad he didn't get hurt.,chit-chat
still it might be worth while to call holmes attention to it,novel
"that's what i'm thinking, but i don't know what to do.",chit-chat
then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat,novel
i don't think i've ever seen a rat before. what was the reference?,chit-chat
what could that mean,novel
"i'm not sure what it means, but i can't wait to see what happens next.",chit-chat
it could not be delirium,novel
"i've never heard of delirium before, but i'll look it up!",chit-chat
a man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay. i know it's hard to lose someone you love.,chit-chat
no it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate,novel
i don't think so. i think it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate.,chit-chat
but what could it indicate,novel
it was the first time i've ever seen it. i'm not sure if i'll ever see it again.,chit-chat
i cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation,novel
why did you cudgelled your brains to find out what was wrong with your brain?,chit-chat
and then the incident of the grey cloth seen by young mccarthy,novel
i'm not familiar with young mccarthy. what's the incident of the grey cloth you're talking about?,chit-chat
if that were true the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress presumably his overcoat in his flight and must have had the hardihood to return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off,novel
that's a good theory. i'm not sure if it's true though.,chit-chat
what a tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was,novel
i know right? i was so mad at myself for not knowing what was going to happen.,chit-chat
i did not wonder at lestrades opinion and yet i had so much faith in sherlock holmes insight that i could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young mccarthys innocence,novel
that's interesting. i'm not familiar with sherlock holmes. what's it about?,chit-chat
it was late before sherlock holmes returned,novel
sherlock holmes is one of my favorite fictional characters. have you seen him in any other movies?,chit-chat
he came back alone for lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town,novel
"wow, that's pretty cool. what did he do to make you think he was going to do that?",chit-chat
the glass still keeps very high he remarked as he sat down,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad he didn't have to sit down.,chit-chat
it is of importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the ground,novel
"that's true, but i'm not sure if it's a good idea to do it that way.",chit-chat
on the other hand a man should be at his very best and keenest for such nice work as that and i did not wish to do it when fagged by a long journey,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i wish i could have done it when i was younger.,chit-chat
i have seen young mccarthy and what did you learn from him nothing could he throw no light none at all,novel
"i'm not familiar with young mccarthy, but i know he's one of the best quarterbacks in the history of football.",chit-chat
i was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had done it and was screening him or her but i am convinced now that he is as puzzled as everyone else,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i don't know what to do now.,chit-chat
he is not a very quickwitted youth though comely to look at and i should think sound at heart i can not admire his taste i remarked if it is indeed a fact that he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this miss turner ah thereby hangs a rather painful tale,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
this fellow is madly insanely in love with her but some two years ago when he was only a lad and before he really knew her for she had been away five years at a boardingschool what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of a barmaid in bristol and marry her at a registry office,novel
"wow, that's crazy. i'm sorry to hear that. how long have you two been together?",chit-chat
no one knows a word of the matter but you can imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to do but what he knows to be absolutely impossible,novel
i can't imagine what it must be like for him to be upbrafor not doing what he would give his very eyes to do but what he knows to be absolutely impossible.,chit-chat
it was sheer frenzy of this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his father at their last interview was goading him on to propose to miss turner,novel
"oh wow, that's really interesting. i've never heard of miss turner before.",chit-chat
on the other hand he had no means of supporting himself and his father who was by all accounts a very hard man would have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth,novel
that's a good point. it's hard to believe he didn't know what he was doing.,chit-chat
it was with his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in bristol and his father did not know where he was,novel
"oh wow, that must have been really hard for him. did he find out where he was?",chit-chat
mark that point,novel
"i've been trying to do that, but i'm not sure how to do it.",chit-chat
it is of importance,novel
"yes, i agree. it is important to have a good relationship with your family and friends.",chit-chat
good has come out of evil however for the barmaid finding from the papers that he is in serious trouble and likely to be hanged has thrown him over utterly and has written to him to say that she has a husband already in the bermuda dockyard so that there is really no tie between them,novel
i don't think i've ever heard of the bermuda dockyard. what is it?,chit-chat
i think that that bit of news has consoled young mccarthy for all that he has suffered but if he is innocent who has done it ah,novel
i don't think so. i think it's more likely that he's guilty.,chit-chat
who,novel
"i've never been to a concert, but i'd like to go one day.",chit-chat
i would call your attention very particularly to two points,novel
i'm not sure what you mean. are you referring to the fact that i didn't get two points?,chit-chat
one is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the pool and that the someone could not have been his son for his son was away and he did not know when he would return,novel
"wow, that's crazy. i don't know what i would do if that happened to me.",chit-chat
the second is that the murdered man was heard to cry cooee before he knew that his son had returned,novel
that's really sad. i'm glad he didn't have to go through that.,chit-chat
those are the crucial points upon which the case depends,novel
i agree. i think i'm going to do my best to keep my grades up.,chit-chat
and now let us talk about george meredith if you please and we shall leave all minor matters until tomorrow there was no rain as holmes had foretold and the morning broke bright and cloudless,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i've never heard of george meredith. what happened to him?,chit-chat
at nine oclock lestrade called for us with the carriage and we set off for hatherley farm and the boscombe pool,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. did you have a good time? did you enjoy it?,chit-chat
there is serious news this morning lestrade observed,novel
that's great news. i'm glad to hear that. what's going on?,chit-chat
it is said that mr turner of the hall is so ill that his life is despaired of an elderly man i presume said holmes,novel
that's really sad to hear. i'm glad he's doing better now.,chit-chat
about sixty but his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad and he has been in failing health for some time,novel
"oh no, i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope he's doing better now.",chit-chat
this business has had a very bad effect upon him,novel
"oh no, what did he do to have such a bad effect on you? what happened?",chit-chat
he was an old friend of mccarthys and i may add a great benefactor to him for i have learned that he gave him hatherley farm rent free indeed,novel
that's really nice of him. i'm glad he's doing well now.,chit-chat
that is interesting said holmes,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you referring to the fact that he's a lawyer?,chit-chat
oh yes,novel
i'm so glad i got to see it. it's been a long time since i've seen it.,chit-chat
in a hundred other ways he has helped him,novel
that's good to hear. i'm glad he's doing well for himself.,chit-chat
everybody about here speaks of his kindness to him really,novel
"yeah, he's a really nice guy. i wish i could have seen him when i was younger.",chit-chat
does it not strike you as a little singular that this mccarthy who appears to have had little of his own and to have been under such obligations to turner should still talk of marrying his son to turners daughter who is presumably heiress to the estate and that in such a very cocksure manner as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would follow,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a big fan of trump.",chit-chat
it is the more strange since we know that turner himself was averse to the idea,novel
"i don't think he was averse to the idea, he just didn't like it.",chit-chat
the daughter told us as much,novel
what did she tell you? i've never heard of a child telling a story like that.,chit-chat
do you not deduce something from that we have got to the deductions and the inferences said lestrade winking at me,novel
"i don't deduct anything from my deductible, but i do owe a lot of money.",chit-chat
i find it hard enough to tackle facts holmes without flying away after theories and fancies you are right said holmes demurely you do find it very hard to tackle the facts anyhow i have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to get hold of replied lestrade with some warmth,novel
what fact do you have that you find it difficult to get hold of replied lestrade with some warmth?,chit-chat
and that is that mccarthy senior met his death from mccarthy junior and that all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine well moonshine is a brighter thing than fog said holmes laughing,novel
i didn't know that. that's so sad. i'm glad he died.,chit-chat
but i am very much mistaken if this is not hatherley farm upon the left yes that is it it was a widespread comfortablelooking building twostoried slateroofed with great yellow blotches of lichen upon the grey walls,novel
"that's interesting. i've never been there, but i'd love to go.",chit-chat
the drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys however gave it a stricken look as though the weight of this horror still lay heavy upon it,novel
that's so scary! i'm glad you're okay. what did you do?,chit-chat
we called at the door when the maid at holmes request showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his death and also a pair of the sons though not the pair which he had then had,novel
that's so sad. i'm sorry you had to go through that. did you find out who did it?,chit-chat
having measured these very carefully from seven or eight different points holmes desired to be led to the courtyard from which we all followed the winding track which led to boscombe pool,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. what did you end up doing to make it that far?,chit-chat
sherlock holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as this,novel
sherlock holmes is one of my favorite fictional characters. it's a shame that he didn't live up to the hype.,chit-chat
men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of baker street would have failed to recognise him,novel
i don't think i've ever heard of a quiet thinker. what does he do?,chit-chat
his face flushed and darkened,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you referring to the way he looks?,chit-chat
his brows were drawn into two hard black lines while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter,novel
"oh my god, that's terrible. i hope he didn't have to go through that.",chit-chat
his face was bent downward his shoulders bowed his lips compressed and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long sinewy neck,novel
"oh my god, that's terrible! i'm so sorry to hear that. what happened?",chit-chat
his nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase and his mind was so absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell unheeded upon his ears or at the most only provoked a quick impatient snarl in reply,novel
"wow, that's pretty interesting. i'm not sure i'd be able to do that.",chit-chat
swiftly and silently he made his way along the track which ran through the meadows and so by way of the woods to the boscombe pool,novel
that's awesome! i've never been to the boscombe pool. what is it like?,chit-chat
it was damp marshy ground as is all that district and there were marks of many feet both upon the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either side,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad it wasn't too bad. what did you do about it?,chit-chat
sometimes holmes would hurry on sometimes stop dead and once he made quite a little detour into the meadow,novel
"that's interesting. i've never heard of him before, but i'm not familiar with him. what did he detour into the meadow for?",chit-chat
lestrade and i walked behind him the detective indifferent and contemptuous while i watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions was directed towards a definite end,novel
"wow, that's pretty intense. what did you do to get away with it? did you get caught?",chit-chat
the boscombe pool which is a little reedgirt sheet of water some fifty yards across is situated at the boundary between the hatherley farm and the private park of the wealthy mr turner,novel
i've always wanted to go to the boscombe pool. have you ever been?,chit-chat
above the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see the red jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich landowners dwelling,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i've never seen that before. do you have a picture of it?",chit-chat
on the hatherley side of the pool the woods grew very thick and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds which lined the lake,novel
"wow, that must have been a long time ago. did you have a good time with it?",chit-chat
lestrade showed us the exact spot at which the body had been found and indeed so moist was the ground that i could plainly see the traces which had been left by the fall of the stricken man,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of lestrade. who is she?,chit-chat
to holmes as i could see by his eager face and peering eyes very many other things were to be read upon the trampled grass,novel
"hello, holmes. how are you doing today? i just got back from the trampled grass.",chit-chat
he ran round like a dog who is picking up a scent and then turned upon my companion,novel
"awww, that's so cute! what kind of dog is it? is it a cat?",chit-chat
what did you go into the pool for he asked,novel
i went into the pool for a swim. it's a really fun place to swim.,chit-chat
i fished about with a rake,novel
that's awesome! what did you do with the rake? did you get hurt?,chit-chat
i thought there might be some weapon or other trace,novel
that's what i'm thinking too. i don't know what's going on.,chit-chat
but how on earth oh tut tut,novel
i don't know... i'm not sure what to do with myself.,chit-chat
i have no time,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. do you have any hobbies that you like to do?,chit-chat
that left foot of yours with its inward twist is all over the place,novel
that's what i'm talking about. i can't believe it's all over the place.,chit-chat
a mole could trace it and there it vanishes among the reeds,novel
a mole could trace it and there it vanishes among the reeds? what does that mean?,chit-chat
oh how simple it would all have been had i been here before they came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over it,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you were able to get back to where you are now.,chit-chat
here is where the party with the lodgekeeper came and they have covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body,novel
"wow, that's a lot of work. i'm glad you're okay.",chit-chat
but here are three separate tracks of the same feet he drew out a lens and lay down upon his waterproof to have a better view talking all the time rather to himself than to us,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. what is your favorite thing to do with your time?,chit-chat
these are young mccarthys feet,novel
that's a good way to look at it. do you have any other hobbies?,chit-chat
twice he was walking and once he ran swiftly so that the soles are deeply marked and the heels hardly visible,novel
oh no! i hate when that happens. i hope he didn't get hurt too bad.,chit-chat
that bears out his story,novel
"yes, it does. i'm so proud of him. he's my best friend.",chit-chat
he ran when he saw his father on the ground,novel
that's so sad. i'm sorry to hear that. did he get hurt?,chit-chat
then here are the fathers feet as he paced up and down,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he's doing well.,chit-chat
what is this then,novel
it's a video game. i've been playing it since i was a kid.,chit-chat
it is the buttend of the gun as the son stood listening,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he's listening.,chit-chat
and this,novel
i'm glad you like it. it's always nice to have something to do.,chit-chat
ha ha,novel
"i'm not sure what you mean by ha ha, but i don't get it.",chit-chat
what have we here,novel
i don't know... i'm not sure what to do with myself.,chit-chat
tiptoes,novel
do you like tiptoes? they are a type of footwear made from toes.,chit-chat
tiptoes,novel
do you like tiptoes? they are a type of footwear made from toes.,chit-chat
square too quite unusual boots,novel
"i know, it's weird. i don't know what to do with them.",chit-chat
they come they go they come againof course that was for the cloak,novel
that's what i was thinking. it's hard to believe they've been doing this for so long.,chit-chat
now where did they come from he ran up and down sometimes losing sometimes finding the track until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a great beech the largest tree in the neighbourhood,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find him.,chit-chat
holmes traced his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon his face with a little cry of satisfaction,novel
"hey holmes, how are you doing today? i hope you're doing well...",chit-chat
for a long time he remained there turning over the leaves and dried sticks gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of the tree as far as he could reach,novel
"wow, that must have been a long time ago. how long did it take you to find him?",chit-chat
a jagged stone was lying among the moss and this also he carefully examined and retained,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad he was able to get away with it.,chit-chat
then he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the high road where all traces were lost,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he didn't get hurt.,chit-chat
it has been a case of considerable interest he remarked returning to his natural manner,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he's doing well.,chit-chat
i fancy that this grey house on the right must be the lodge,novel
the grey house on the right must be the lodge. i've never heard of it.,chit-chat
i think that i will go in and have a word with moran and perhaps write a little note,novel
that's a good idea. i'm sure you'll have a great time.,chit-chat
having done that we may drive back to our luncheon,novel
that's a good idea. i'm sure you'll have a great time.,chit-chat
you may walk to the cab and i shall be with you presently it was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove back into ross holmes still carrying with him the stone which he had picked up in the wood,novel
that's really nice of him. i'm sure he's a great person.,chit-chat
this may interest you lestrade he remarked holding it out,novel
"i don't know what that means, but i'm not sure what you mean.",chit-chat
the murder was done with it i see no marks there are none how do you know then the grass was growing under it,novel
"that's a good question. i'm not sure, but i do know that i've never seen it.",chit-chat
it had only lain there a few days,novel
"i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're feeling better now, though.",chit-chat
there was no sign of a place whence it had been taken,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. did you find out who took it or what?,chit-chat
it corresponds with the injuries,novel
that's a good way to look at it. do you have any experience with injuries?,chit-chat
there is no sign of any other weapon and the murderer is a tall man lefthanded limps with the right leg wears thicksoled shootingboots and a grey cloak smokes indian cigars uses a cigarholder and carries a blunt penknife in his pocket,novel
"wow, that's scary. i'm glad he didn't kill anyone, though.",chit-chat
there are several other indications but these may be enough to aid us in our search lestrade laughed,novel
what are some of the other indications? i'm not familiar with the ones you're talking about.,chit-chat
i am afraid that i am still a sceptic he said,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did he say about you being a sceptic?,chit-chat
theories are all very well but we have to deal with a hardheaded british jury _nous verrons_ answered holmes calmly,novel
i'm not familiar with the british jury. what's it like to be on a jury of your own?,chit-chat
you work your own method and i shall work mine,novel
that's what i'm trying to do. i just don't know how to do it.,chit-chat
i shall be busy this afternoon and shall probably return to london by the evening train and leave your case unfinished no finished but the mystery it is solved who was the criminal then the gentleman i describe but who is he surely it would not be difficult to find out,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. i'm sure you'll have a great time.,chit-chat
this is not such a populous neighbourhood lestrade shrugged his shoulders,novel
i don't think i've ever seen a lestrade on the street before.,chit-chat
i am a practical man he said and i really can not undertake to go about the country looking for a lefthanded gentleman with a game leg,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you find someone that you can work with.,chit-chat
i should become the laughingstock of scotland yard all right said holmes quietly,novel
"haha, that's a great idea! i'm sure you'd have a great time!",chit-chat
i have given you the chance,novel
that's nice of you to say. what did you give me the chance to do?,chit-chat
here are your lodgings,novel
what do you mean by lodgings? i'm not sure what you mean.,chit-chat
goodbye,novel
"hello, how are you? i just got back from a long day at work...",chit-chat
i shall drop you a line before i leave having left lestrade at his rooms we drove to our hotel where we found lunch upon the table,novel
that's really nice of you to do. i'm sure you'll be fine.,chit-chat
holmes was silent and buried in thought with a pained expression upon his face as one who finds himself in a perplexing position,novel
"hello, holmes. how are you doing today? i hope you are having a good day.",chit-chat
look here watson he said when the cloth was cleared just sit down in this chair and let me preach to you for a little,novel
i'm not sure what you're trying to say. are you trying to tell me something i don't know?,chit-chat
i dont know quite what to do and i should value your advice,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what do you think you're going to do?,chit-chat
light a cigar and let me expound pray do so well now in considering this case there are two points about young mccarthys narrative which struck us both instantly although they impressed me in his favour and you against him,novel
i'm not familiar with young mccarthys narrative. what's it about exactly?,chit-chat
one was the fact that his father should according to his account cry cooee before seeing him,novel
that's so sad. i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's doing better now.,chit-chat
the other was his singular dying reference to a rat,novel
what was the other reference to? i've never heard of that before. what's it about?,chit-chat
he mumbled several words you understand but that was all that caught the sons ear,novel
"i know, i was so shocked. i can't believe he didn't know what he was talking about.",chit-chat
now from this double point our research must commence and we will begin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true what of this cooee then well obviously it could not have been meant for the son,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he's doing well.,chit-chat
the son as far as he knew was in bristol,novel
"oh, that's terrible. i'm so sorry to hear that. what happened?",chit-chat
it was mere chance that he was within earshot,novel
that's what i was thinking. i'm glad he didn't get hurt.,chit-chat
the cooee was meant to attract the attention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with,novel
that makes a lot of sense. i didn't know that. thank you for the information.,chit-chat
but cooee is a distinctly australian cry and one which is used between australians,novel
i've never heard of cooee. i'll have to look it up. what's it about?,chit-chat
there is a strong presumption that the person whom mccarthy expected to meet him at boscombe pool was someone who had been in australia what of the rat then sherlock holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it out on the table,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. i didn't know sherlock holmes was in australia.",chit-chat
this is a map of the colony of victoria he said,novel
"oh wow, that's really cool. i've always wanted to visit victoria. have you ever been?",chit-chat
i wired to bristol for it last night he put his hand over part of the map,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never done that before. what did you do?,chit-chat
what do you read arat i read,novel
"i'm not sure what arat is, but i do know it's a science fiction novel.",chit-chat
and now he raised his hand,novel
that's what i was thinking. i'm so proud of him for doing that.,chit-chat
ballarat quite so,novel
i love ballarat! it's one of my favorite foods. do you like it?,chit-chat
that was the word the man uttered and of which his son only caught the last two syllables,novel
"wow, that's impressive. i've never heard that word before. what does it mean?",chit-chat
he was trying to utter the name of his murderer,novel
oh no! what did you say to him? did he say anything to you about it?,chit-chat
so and so of ballarat it is wonderful i exclaimed,novel
i love ballarat! it's one of my favorite things to do in my free time.,chit-chat
it is obvious,novel
"i don't think it's obvious to most people, but i'm not sure why.",chit-chat
and now you see i had narrowed the field down considerably,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to work it out.,chit-chat
the possession of a grey garment was a third point which granting the sons statement to be correct was a certainty,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what happened to the son's statement to be correct?,chit-chat
we have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an australian from ballarat with a grey cloak certainly and one who was at home in the district for the pool can only be approached by the farm or by the estate where strangers could hardly wander quite so then comes our expedition of today,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i've never heard of an australian from ballarat before.",chit-chat
by an examination of the ground i gained the trifling details which i gave to that imbecile lestrade as to the personality of the criminal but how did you gain them you know my method,novel
that's a very interesting way to look at it. how did you come to that conclusion?,chit-chat
it is founded upon the observation of trifles his height i know that you might roughly judge from the length of his stride,novel
"that's a good point. i'm not sure how tall he is, though.",chit-chat
his boots too might be told from their traces yes they were peculiar boots but his lameness the impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his left,novel
"that's a good point, i didn't think of that. i'll have to think about that.",chit-chat
he put less weight upon it,novel
"that's a good way to look at it, but i don't think i could do that.",chit-chat
why,novel
i don't know what to do with my life. i just want to be happy.,chit-chat
because he limpedhe was lame but his lefthandedness you were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by the surgeon at the inquest,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're feeling better now. do you feel better now?,chit-chat
the blow was struck from immediately behind and yet was upon the left side,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay and that your family is okay.,chit-chat
now how can that be unless it were by a lefthanded man,novel
i don't know... i'm a lefthanded man and i can't help it.,chit-chat
he had stood behind that tree during the interview between the father and son,novel
that's really cool. i'm glad he was able to get away with it.,chit-chat
he had even smoked there,novel
"i know, i was so mad at him. i don't know what to do now.",chit-chat
i found the ash of a cigar which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an indian cigar,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of that before. where did you find it?,chit-chat
i have as you know devoted some attention to this and written a little monograph on the ashes of 140 different varieties of pipe cigar and cigarette tobacco,novel
"wow, that's a lot of pipe tobacco! how long have you been smoking it?",chit-chat
having found the ash i then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss where he had tossed it,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. did you find the ash or did he throw it?",chit-chat
it was an indian cigar of the variety which are rolled in rotterdam and the cigarholder i could see that the end had not been in his mouth,novel
that's interesting. i've never had one of those before. what was the name of it?,chit-chat
therefore he used a holder,novel
"that's what i was thinking, but i don't think it was a holder.",chit-chat
the tip had been cut off not bitten off but the cut was not a clean one so i deduced a blunt penknife holmes i said you have drawn a net round this man from which he can not escape and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as if you had cut the cord which was hanging him,novel
"wow, that's really cool. i've never heard of a penknife holmes before.",chit-chat
i see the direction in which all this points,novel
what is the direction in which all this points? i'm not sure what you mean.,chit-chat
the culprit is mr,novel
i've never heard of the culprit. what's it about? do you know much about it?,chit-chat
john turner cried the hotel waiter opening the door of our sittingroom and ushering in a visitor,novel
john turner cried the hotel waiter opening the door of our sittingroom and ushering in a visitor,chit-chat
the man who entered was a strange and impressive figure,novel
the man who entered was a strange and impressive figure... what did you think of him?,chit-chat
his slow limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude and yet his hard deeplined craggy features and his enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of character,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're doing better now than you used to be.,chit-chat
his tangled beard grizzled hair and outstanding drooping eyebrows combined to give an air of dignity and power to his appearance but his face was of an ashen white while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue,novel
"wow, that's pretty interesting. what did you do to make him feel better about himself?",chit-chat
it was clear to me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he's okay.,chit-chat
pray sit down on the sofa said holmes gently,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're feeling better. what happened?,chit-chat
you had my note yes the lodgekeeper brought it up,novel
what did they bring it up to? i've never heard of a lodgekeeper before.,chit-chat
you said that you wished to see me here to avoid scandal i thought people would talk if i went to the hall and why did you wish to see me he looked across at my companion with despair in his weary eyes as though his question was already answered,novel
i wish to see you here to avoid scandal i thought people would talk if i went to the hall and why did you want to see me he looked across at my companion with despair in his weary eyes as though his question was already answered,chit-chat
yes said holmes answering the look rather than the words,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you referring to the fact that he didn't answer the question?,chit-chat
it is so,novel
it really is. i can't believe it's been so long since i've seen it.,chit-chat
i know all about mccarthy the old man sank his face in his hands,novel
i know all about mccarthy the old man sunk his face in his hands... lol,chit-chat
god help me he cried,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did he do to make you feel that way?,chit-chat
but i would not have let the young man come to harm,novel
"i would have done the same thing, but i was so scared he was going to attack me.",chit-chat
i give you my word that i would have spoken out if it went against him at the assizes i am glad to hear you say so said holmes gravely,novel
i'm glad to hear that. i don't know what i would have done.,chit-chat
i would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to talk to her about it.,chit-chat
it would break her heartit will break her heart when she hears that i am arrested it may not come to that said holmes,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get away with it.,chit-chat
what i am no official agent,novel
"i'm sorry to hear that. what do you do for a living, if you don't mind me asking?",chit-chat
i understand that it was your daughter who required my presence here and i am acting in her interests,novel
that's good to hear. i'm glad you're acting in her interest.,chit-chat
young mccarthy must be got off however i am a dying man said old turner,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're feeling better now. what happened to you?,chit-chat
i have had diabetes for years,novel
"oh no, i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're doing better now.",chit-chat
my doctor says it is a question whether i shall live a month,novel

i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're feeling better now. what happened?,chit-chat
i could see a change in my uncle however,novel
why does he have a change in him? what is it about him that makes you feel that way?,chit-chat
he drank more than ever and he was less inclined for any sort of society,novel
"i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's doing better now, though.",chit-chat
most of his time he would spend in his room with the door locked upon the inside but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy and would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a revolver in his hand screaming out that he was afraid of no man and that he was not to be cooped up like a sheep in a pen by man or devil,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. i'm glad you have someone to talk to about it.,chit-chat
when these hot fits were over however he would rush tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the roots of his soul,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun! i'm glad he's doing better now.,chit-chat
at such times i have seen his face even on a cold day glisten with moisture as though it were new raised from a basin,novel
"that's pretty cool. i've never seen him before, but i'd love to see his face.",chit-chat
well to come to an end of the matter mr holmes and not to abuse your patience there came a night when he made one of those drunken sallies from which he never came back,novel
that's so funny! i'm glad he didn't come back. what was the name of the sally?,chit-chat
we found him when we went to search for him face downward in a little greenscummed pool which lay at the foot of the garden,novel
that's awesome! i'm glad you found him. do you have any other pets?,chit-chat
there was no sign of any violence and the water was but two feet deep so that the jury having regard to his known eccentricity brought in a verdict of suicide but i who knew how he winced from the very thought of death had much ado to persuade myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're doing better now. what happened to him?,chit-chat
the matter passed however and my father entered into possession of the estate and of some 14000 which lay to his credit at the bank one moment holmes interposed your statement is i foresee one of the most remarkable to which i have ever listened,novel
"wow, that's a lot of money. i'm so sorry to hear that.",chit-chat
let me have the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter and the date of his supposed suicide the letter arrived on march 10 1883,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get through it.,chit-chat
his death was seven weeks later upon the night of may 2nd thank you,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i know how hard it is to lose a loved one.,chit-chat
pray proceed when my father took over the horsham property he at my request made a careful examination of the attic which had been always locked up,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get it fixed.,chit-chat
we found the brass box there although its contents had been destroyed,novel
oh no! that's so sad. i hope you find it. i'm sorry to hear that.,chit-chat
on the inside of the cover was a paper label with the initials of k k k repeated upon it and letters memoranda receipts and a register written beneath,novel
that's pretty cool. did you find out who it was or what it was for?,chit-chat
these we presume indicated the nature of the papers which had been destroyed by colonel openshaw,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. colonel openshaw is such a great man.,chit-chat
for the rest there was nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many scattered papers and notebooks bearing upon my uncles life in america,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. it's always nice to have a good memory in the attic.,chit-chat
some of them were of the war time and showed that he had done his duty well and had borne the repute of a brave soldier,novel
thank you for your service. i'm glad to hear that he did his duty well.,chit-chat
others were of a date during the reconstruction of the southern states and were mostly concerned with politics for he had evidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpetbag politicians who had been sent down from the north,novel
that's interesting. i didn't know that. do you have a source for that?,chit-chat
well it was the beginning of 84 when my father came to live at horsham and all went as well as possible with us until the january of 85,novel
"wow, that's a long time. how long did it take for him to get there?",chit-chat
on the fourth day after the new year i heard my father give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfasttable,novel
that's really sweet of him. did you guys have a good time at the breakfasttable?,chit-chat
there he was sitting with a newly opened envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the outstretched palm of the other one,novel
"wow, that's a lot of orange pips. what did he do with them?",chit-chat
he had always laughed at what he called my cockandbull story about the colonel but he looked very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon himself,novel
that's so funny! did you tell him about it? did he laugh at you?,chit-chat
why what on earth does this mean john he stammered,novel
i don't know. i'm not sure why he stammailed it to me.,chit-chat
my heart had turned to lead,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do to make your heart turn to lead?,chit-chat
it is k k k said i,novel
"i'm not sure what that means, but i know it's not what i want to hear.",chit-chat
he looked inside the envelope,novel
"oh, i didn't see that. what did he look in the envelope for, if you don't mind me asking?",chit-chat
so it is he cried,novel
"i think so, but i don't know if it's a good thing or not.",chit-chat
here are the very letters,novel
what do you mean by that? i'm not sure what you're trying to say.,chit-chat
but what is this written above them put the papers on the sundial i read peeping over his shoulder,novel
that's a good question. i'm not sure what it's written about.,chit-chat
what papers,novel
papers for my papers. i've been trying to get my papers for a while now.,chit-chat
what sundial he asked,novel
i don't know what sundial he's talking about. i'm not sure what he means by sundial.,chit-chat
the sundial in the garden,novel
i love the sundial in the garden. it's one of my favorite things to do.,chit-chat
there is no other said i but the papers must be those that are destroyed pooh said he gripping hard at his courage,novel
"i don't know who pooh is, but i'm glad to hear he's doing well.",chit-chat
we are in a civilised land here and we cant have tomfoolery of this kind,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what kind of tomfoolery are you talking about?,chit-chat
where does the thing come from from dundee i answered glancing at the postmark,novel
"i'm not sure, but i can't find it anywhere. what did you answer?",chit-chat
some preposterous practical joke said he,novel
"i'm not sure what that means, but i'll tell you anyway...",chit-chat
what have i to do with sundials and papers,novel
what are you going to do with sundials and papers? what do you do with them?,chit-chat
i shall take no notice of such nonsense i should certainly speak to the police i said,novel
that's what i'm going to do. i don't know what to do with myself.,chit-chat
and be laughed at for my pains,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
nothing of the sort then let me do so no i forbid you,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do to make you feel that way?,chit-chat
i wont have a fuss made about such nonsense it was in vain to argue with him for he was a very obstinate man,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to work it out.,chit-chat
i went about however with a heart which was full of forebodings,novel
that's so sad. i'm sorry you had to go through that. what happened?,chit-chat
on the third day after the coming of the letter my father went from home to visit an old friend of his major freebody who is in command of one of the forts upon portsdown hill,novel
that's really sweet of him. i'm sure he's proud of you.,chit-chat
i was glad that he should go for it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away from home,novel
that's good to hear. i'm glad he didn't go for it.,chit-chat
in that however i was in error,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're doing better now. what happened?,chit-chat
upon the second day of his absence i received a telegram from the major imploring me to come at once,novel
that's a bummer. i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do?,chit-chat
my father had fallen over one of the deep chalkpits which abound in the neighbourhood and was lying senseless with a shattered skull,novel
that's terrible. i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope he's okay.,chit-chat
i hurried to him but he passed away without having ever recovered his consciousness,novel
"oh no, i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope he's doing better now.",chit-chat
he had as it appears been returning from fareham in the twilight and as the country was unknown to him and the chalkpit unfenced the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of death from accidental causes carefully as i examined every fact connected with his death i was unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of murder,novel
"wow, that's crazy. i'm sorry to hear that. what happened to fareham?",chit-chat
there were no signs of violence no footmarks no robbery no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads,novel
i'm so sorry that happened to you. i hope you're okay. what did you do?,chit-chat
and yet i need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease and that i was wellnigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
in this sinister way i came into my inheritance,novel
why did you do that? did you have to go through a lot of hard work to get it?,chit-chat
you will ask me why i did not dispose of it,novel
why did you not dispose of it? did you have to clean it up after yourself?,chit-chat
i answer because i was well convinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncles life and that the danger would be as pressing in one house as in another,novel
that's a good reason to answer. i'm sorry you had to go through that.,chit-chat
it was in january 85 that my poor father met his end and two years and eight months have elapsed since then,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. it's hard to lose someone you love.,chit-chat
during that time i have lived happily at horsham and i had begun to hope that this curse had passed away from the family and that it had ended with the last generation,novel
"oh no, i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're doing better now.",chit-chat
i had begun to take comfort too soon however yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in which it had come upon my father the young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope and turning to the table he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips,novel
that's really nice of him. i'm sure he's proud of you.,chit-chat
this is the envelope he continued,novel
that's a good one. i'm happy for him. i hope he's doing well.,chit-chat
the postmark is londoneastern division,novel
i'm not familiar with the postmark. what's it about? do you know anything about it?,chit-chat
within are the very words which were upon my fathers last message k,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get through it.,chit-chat
k k and then put the papers on the sundial what have you done asked holmes,novel
i haven't done anything yet. i'm not sure what i'll do.,chit-chat
nothing nothing to tell the truthhe sank his face into his thin white handsi have felt helpless,novel
i don't think i've ever seen a truthhe in person before. what color is he?,chit-chat
i have felt like one of those poor rabbits when the snake is writhing towards it,novel
"i know, right? i can't even imagine what it's like to have that happen to you.",chit-chat
i seem to be in the grasp of some resistless inexorable evil which no foresight and no precautions can guard against tut,novel
that's a good way to look at it. what do you do for a living?,chit-chat
tut cried sherlock holmes,novel
i've never seen a tut cry sherlock holmes. what is it about him that you like so much?,chit-chat
you must act man or you are lost,novel
i don't know. i'm not sure what to do. i feel like i've lost everything.,chit-chat
nothing but energy can save you,novel
"that's true, but i'm not sure if i'll be able to do it.",chit-chat
this is no time for despair i have seen the police ah but they listened to my story with a smile,novel
that's good to hear. i'm glad you were able to get away with it.,chit-chat
i am convinced that the inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical jokes and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents as the jury stated and were not to be connected with the warnings holmes shook his clenched hands in the air,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to work through it.,chit-chat
incredible imbecility he cried,novel
i know right? i can't even imagine what it must have been like to have that happen to you.,chit-chat
they have however allowed me a policeman who may remain in the house with me has he come with you tonight no,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get away with it.,chit-chat
his orders were to stay in the house again holmes raved in the air,novel
"wow, that's crazy. i hope he didn't get in trouble for it.",chit-chat
why did you come to me he said and above all why did you not come at once i did not know,novel
i don't know. i'm not sure why i didn't come at all.,chit-chat
it was only today that i spoke to major prendergast about my troubles and was advised by him to come to you it is really two days since you had the letter,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you talk to major prendergast about?,chit-chat
we should have acted before this,novel
"what did you do? i'm not sure what you mean by "" acted before "".",chit-chat
you have no further evidence i suppose than that which you have placed before usno suggestive detail which might help us there is one thing said john openshaw,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. what is john openshaw saying?,chit-chat
he rummaged in his coat pocket and drawing out a piece of discoloured bluetinted paper he laid it out upon the table,novel
that's really interesting. did you find out who did it or did you just find out?,chit-chat
i have some remembrance said he that on the day when my uncle burned the papers i observed that the small unburned margins which lay amid the ashes were of this particular colour,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. did you find out who did it or what happened?",chit-chat
i found this single sheet upon the floor of his room and i am inclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has perhaps fluttered out from among the others and in that way has escaped destruction,novel
"that's a good theory, but i'm not sure if it's true.",chit-chat
beyond the mention of pips i do not see that it helps us much,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you referring to the fact that you don't see it?,chit-chat
i think myself that it is a page from some private diary,novel
that's a good way to look at it. do you think it's true?,chit-chat
the writing is undoubtedly my uncles holmes moved the lamp and we both bent over the sheet of paper which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book,novel
that's a bummer. i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do about it?,chit-chat
it was headed march 1869 and beneath were the following enigmatical notices 4th,novel
"wow, that's a long time. i'm sorry to hear that. what happened?",chit-chat
hudson came,novel
i love to go to the beach with my family. it's such a beautiful place.,chit-chat

i love john swain st. augustine. he's one of my favorite musicians.,chit-chat
9th,novel
do you have a favorite color? mine is blue. it's between green and red.,chit-chat
mccauley cleared,novel
have you ever heard of mccauley cleared? it's a song by the beatles.,chit-chat
10th,novel
do you have a favorite color? mine is blue. it's between green and red.,chit-chat
john swain cleared,novel
"have you heard of john swain? he is an american singer, songwriter, and record producer.",chit-chat
12th,novel
i've always wanted to go to hawaii. it's the capital of the united states.,chit-chat
visited paramore,novel
have you ever been to paramore? it's an american rock band from the uk.,chit-chat
all well thank you said holmes folding up the paper and returning it to our visitor,novel
you're welcome! i'm so happy for you. i hope you have a great day!,chit-chat
and now you must on no account lose another instant,novel
that's what i'm thinking. i don't know what to do with myself.,chit-chat
we can not spare time even to discuss what you have told me,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what's going on in your life right now?,chit-chat
you must get home instantly and act what shall i do there is but one thing to do,novel
"that's what i'm trying to do, but i don't know what to do.",chit-chat
it must be done at once,novel
"it must be done at once, too. it's been a long time since i've done anything like that.",chit-chat
you must put this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which you have described,novel
that's a good idea. i'll have to do that when i get home from work.,chit-chat
you must also put in a note to say that all the other papers were burned by your uncle and that this is the only one which remains,novel
"that's a good idea, i'll do that. i don't know what to do.",chit-chat
you must assert that in such words as will carry conviction with them,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i think i'll do that.,chit-chat
having done this you must at once put the box out upon the sundial as directed,novel
"that's a good idea, i'll have to try that. do you have a sundial?",chit-chat
do you understand entirely do not think of revenge or anything of the sort at present,novel
"i don't think of it as revenge, but i do think it's a good thing.",chit-chat
i think that we may gain that by means of the law but we have our web to weave while theirs is already woven,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i don't think i could do that.,chit-chat
the first consideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens you,novel
that's a good idea. i think i'm going to do that. thank you!,chit-chat
the second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the guilty parties i thank you said the young man rising and pulling on his overcoat,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i think i'm going to do that.,chit-chat
you have given me fresh life and hope,novel
"i'm so glad to hear that. i hope you have a great day, too.",chit-chat
i shall certainly do as you advise do not lose an instant,novel
"thank you, i appreciate that. i'm going to try my best to stay positive.",chit-chat
and above all take care of yourself in the meanwhile for i do not think that there can be a doubt that you are threatened by a very real and imminent danger,novel
that's true. i'm glad i don't have to deal with that anymore.,chit-chat
how do you go back by train from waterloo it is not yet nine,novel
"i don't know, i've never been on a train before. i'm sorry.",chit-chat
the streets will be crowded so i trust that you may be in safety,novel
that's a good point. i think i'm going to try to stay safe.,chit-chat
and yet you can not guard yourself too closely i am armed that is well,novel
that's good to hear. i'm glad you're well armed. what do you do for fun?,chit-chat
tomorrow i shall set to work upon your case i shall see you at horsham then no your secret lies in london,novel
sounds like a plan to me. i'm sure you'll have a great time.,chit-chat
it is there that i shall seek it then i shall call upon you in a day or in two days with news as to the box and the papers,novel
that's nice of you to do. i'm sure you'll find it.,chit-chat
i shall take your advice in every particular he shook hands with us and took his leave,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did he do to make you feel that way?,chit-chat
outside the wind still screamed and the rain splashed and pattered against the windows,novel
oh no! i hope it wasn't too bad. what did you do about it?,chit-chat
this strange wild story seemed to have come to us from amid the mad elementsblown in upon us like a sheet of seaweed in a galeand now to have been reabsorbed by them once more,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i'm not sure i've ever heard of that before.",chit-chat
sherlock holmes sat for some time in silence with his head sunk forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire,novel
"wow, sherlock holmes is one of my favorite fictional characters. have you read any of his novels?",chit-chat
then he lit his pipe and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smokerings as they chased each other up to the ceiling,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad he didn't have to do that.,chit-chat
i think watson he remarked at last that of all our cases we have had none more fantastic than this save perhaps the sign of four well yes,novel
"i don't know about watson, but i'm happy for him. he's a great manager.",chit-chat
save perhaps that,novel
"i've been saving for a while, but i'm not sure if it's worth it.",chit-chat
and yet this john openshaw seems to me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the sholtos but have you i asked formed any definite conception as to what these perils are there can be no question as to their nature he answered,novel
i've never heard of john openshaw. what does he say about sholtos?,chit-chat
then what are they,novel
"i'm not sure what they're, but i do know they've been around for a long time.",chit-chat
who is this k k k and why does he pursue this unhappy family sherlock holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of his chair with his fingertips together,novel
"i'm not sure who sherlock holmes is, but i do know that he's a real life sherlock holmes.",chit-chat
the ideal reasoner he remarked would when he had once been shown a single fact in all its bearings deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up to it but also all the results which would follow from it,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never heard of that before. what's it about?,chit-chat
as cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other ones both before and after,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of cuvier before. what's his name?,chit-chat
we have not yet grasped the results which the reason alone can attain to,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to reach your goals.,chit-chat
problems may be solved in the study which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid of their senses,novel
"that's a good point, i didn't think of that. i'll have to look into that.",chit-chat
to carry the art however to its highest pitch it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge and this in itself implies as you will readily see a possession of all knowledge which even in these days of free education and encyclopædias is a somewhat rare accomplishment,novel
that's a very good point. i think it's important to be able to use all of your knowledge in one way or another.,chit-chat
it is not so impossible however that a man should possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work and this i have endeavoured in my case to do,novel
that's a great way to look at it. i'm glad you're able to do that.,chit-chat
if i remember rightly you on one occasion in the early days of our friendship defined my limits in a very precise fashion yes i answered laughing,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad it worked out for you.,chit-chat
it was a singular document,novel
that's not good. i'm sorry to hear that. what did you end up doing?,chit-chat
philosophy astronomy and politics were marked at zero i remember,novel
i remember philosophy astronomy and politics were marked zero. i remember that too. it's been a while since i took it.,chit-chat
botany variable geology profound as regards the mudstains from any region within fifty miles of town chemistry eccentric anatomy unsystematic sensational literature and crime records unique violinplayer boxer swordsman lawyer and selfpoisoner by cocaine and tobacco,novel
"i've never heard of a botany variable geology, but i'm sure it's interesting.",chit-chat
those i think were the main points of my analysis holmes grinned at the last item,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're doing well in your analysis.,chit-chat
well he said i say now as i said then that a man should keep his little brainattic stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use and the rest he can put away in the lumberroom of his library where he can get it if he wants it,novel
that's a good idea. i've never thought of that before. i think i'll do that.,chit-chat
now for such a case as the one which has been submitted to us tonight we need certainly to muster all our resources,novel
what case are you referring to? i'm not familiar with the case you're talking about.,chit-chat
kindly hand me down the letter k of the _american encyclopædia_ which stands upon the shelf beside you,novel
that's very nice of you. i'm sure you'll find it very useful.,chit-chat
thank you,novel
you're welcome. i'm glad you like it. i hope you enjoy it.,chit-chat
now let us consider the situation and see what may be deduced from it,novel
i don't think i'll be able to. i'm not sure what to do.,chit-chat
in the first place we may start with a strong presumption that colonel openshaw had some very strong reason for leaving america,novel
i'm not familiar with colonel openshaw. what is his reason for leaving america?,chit-chat
men at his time of life do not change all their habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of florida for the lonely life of an english provincial town,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. do you have any advice on how to change your habits?,chit-chat
his extreme love of solitude in england suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone or something so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of someone or something which drove him from america,novel
i don't think he was afraid of anyone. i think he just wanted to be alone.,chit-chat
as to what it was he feared we can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters which were received by himself and his successors,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think of that. i'll have to look into that.,chit-chat
did you remark the postmarks of those letters the first was from pondicherry the second from dundee and the third from london from east london,novel
i didn't. i'm not sure what that means. i don't know what it means.,chit-chat
what do you deduce from that they are all seaports,novel
i don't know. it's been a while since i've been there.,chit-chat
that the writer was on board of a ship excellent,novel
that's really cool. what kind of ship was it? was it a big one?,chit-chat
we have already a clue,novel
oh really? i didn't see it. i'm so sorry. i don't know what i was thinking.,chit-chat
there can be no doubt that the probabilitythe strong probabilityis that the writer was on board of a ship,novel
i don't think so. i think it's more likely that the writer was on board of a ship.,chit-chat
and now let us consider another point,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you referring to the fact that we lost?,chit-chat
in the case of pondicherry seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment in dundee it was only some three or four days,novel
"wow, that's a long time. i'm glad it's over now.",chit-chat
does that suggest anything a greater distance to travel but the letter had also a greater distance to come then i do not see the point there is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or men are is a sailingship,novel
i don't think it's a sailingship. i think it is a boat.,chit-chat
it looks as if they always send their singular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i don't think i've ever done that before.,chit-chat
you see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from dundee,novel
that's a good way to look at it. what did you do to get the sign?,chit-chat
if they had come from pondicherry in a steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter,novel
that's a good point. i don't think i've ever heard of a steamer before.,chit-chat
but as a matter of fact seven weeks elapsed,novel
"wow, that's a long time to be away from your family. do you have any kids?",chit-chat
i think that those seven weeks represented the difference between the mailboat which brought the letter and the sailing vessel which brought the writer it is possible more than that,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think of it that way. do you have a favorite mailboat?,chit-chat
it is probable,novel
"i don't know what that means, but i'm not sure what it means.",chit-chat

it is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch the last train from waterloo station and that in his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge of one of the small landingplaces for river steamboats,novel

"wow, that's interesting. i've never heard of holmes before. what's his name?",chit-chat

theres plenty of thread no doubt but i cant get the end of it into my hand,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what's wrong with the end of the thread?,chit-chat
now ill state the case clearly and concisely to you watson and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me proceed then some years agoto be definite in may 1884there came to lee a gentleman neville st clair by name who appeared to have plenty of money,novel
"i've never heard of agoto before, but i'm not familiar with it. what's it about?",chit-chat
he took a large villa laid out the grounds very nicely and lived generally in good style,novel

"wow, that must have been a long time ago. did he have a lot of success?",chit-chat
he had no occupation but was interested in several companies and went into town as a rule in the morning returning by the 514 from cannon street every night,novel

mr st clair is now thirtyseven years of age is a man of temperate habits a good husband a very affectionate father and a man who is popular with all who know him,novel
i'm not familiar with mr. st. clair. what does he do for a living?,chit-chat
i may add that his whole debts at the present moment as far as we have been able to ascertain amount to 88 10_s_ while he has 220 standing to his credit in the capital and counties bank,novel
"wow, that's a lot of debt. i'm so sorry to hear that.",chit-chat
there is no reason therefore to think that money troubles have been weighing upon his mind,novel
i don't think so. i think he just doesn't know what to do with his money.,chit-chat
last monday mr neville st clair went into town rather earlier than usual remarking before he started that he had two important commissions to perform and that he would bring his little boy home a box of bricks,novel
that's so nice of him to do that. i'm sure he appreciated it.,chit-chat
now by the merest chance his wife received a telegram upon this same monday very shortly after his departure to the effect that a small parcel of considerable value which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the offices of the aberdeen shipping company,novel
that's really nice of him. i'm glad he's doing well now.,chit-chat
now if you are well up in your london you will know that the office of the company is in fresno street which branches out of upper swandam lane where you found me tonight,novel
i've never heard of fresno street. i'll have to check it out next time i'm in london.,chit-chat
mrs st clair had her lunch started for the city did some shopping proceeded to the companys office got her packet and found herself at exactly 435 walking through swandam lane on her way back to the station,novel
"wow, that's a lot of shopping to do. did you find out who did it?",chit-chat
have you followed me so far it is very clear if you remember monday was an exceedingly hot day and mrs st clair walked slowly glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab as she did not like the neighbourhood in which she found herself,novel
i have not followed you so far. i do not know what you are talking about. what did you do?,chit-chat
while she was walking in this way down swandam lane she suddenly heard an ejaculation or cry and was struck cold to see her husband looking down at her and as it seemed to her beckoning to her from a secondfloor window,novel
"wow, that must have been scary. i hope she didn't have to go through that.",chit-chat
the window was open and she distinctly saw his face which she describes as being terribly agitated,novel
that's terrible. i hate when people do that to me. what did you do?,chit-chat
he waved his hands frantically to her and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from behind,novel
"wow, that's pretty crazy. i'm glad he didn't hurt her.",chit-chat
one singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that although he wore some dark coat such as he had started to town in he had on neither collar nor necktie,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of that before. what did he do?,chit-chat
convinced that something was amiss with him she rushed down the stepsfor the house was none other than the opium den in which you found me tonightand running through the front room she attempted to ascend the stairs which led to the first floor,novel
"wow, that's crazy. i'm sorry you had to go through that. what did you do?",chit-chat
at the foot of the stairs however she met this lascar scoundrel of whom i have spoken who thrust her back and aided by a dane who acts as assistant there pushed her out into the street,novel
"wow, that's crazy. i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do?",chit-chat
filled with the most maddening doubts and fears she rushed down the lane and by rare goodfortune met in fresno street a number of constables with an inspector all on their way to their beat,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. what do you like to do in your free time?,chit-chat
the inspector and two men accompanied her back and in spite of the continued resistance of the proprietor they made their way to the room in which mr st clair had last been seen,novel
"hello, how are you doing today? i just got back from walking by mr. clair.",chit-chat
there was no sign of him there,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find him soon.,chit-chat
in fact in the whole of that floor there was no one to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect who it seems made his home there,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope he's ok now. what happened?,chit-chat
both he and the lascar stoutly swore that no one else had been in the front room during the afternoon,novel
that's not good. i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do?,chit-chat
so determined was their denial that the inspector was staggered and had almost come to believe that mrs st clair had been deluded when with a cry she sprang at a small deal box which lay upon the table and tore the lid from it,novel
"oh my god, that's terrible. i'm so sorry you had to go through that.",chit-chat
out there fell a cascade of childrens bricks,novel
oh no! that's terrible! i hope you're okay. what did you do?,chit-chat
it was the toy which he had promised to bring home,novel
what kind of toy was it? i hope it wasn't a toy from a toy store.,chit-chat
this discovery and the evident confusion which the cripple showed made the inspector realise that the matter was serious,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do to make him realize it was serious?,chit-chat
the rooms were carefully examined and results all pointed to an abominable crime,novel
that's really scary. i hope you're able to find out who did it.,chit-chat
the front room was plainly furnished as a sittingroom and led into a small bedroom which looked out upon the back of one of the wharves,novel
"wow, that must have been scary! did you find out who did it? did anyone find out?",chit-chat
between the wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip which is dry at low tide but is covered at high tide with at least four and a half feet of water,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. i'd love to go there one day. have you ever been?,chit-chat
the bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below,novel
"oh wow, that must have been scary. did you have to get out of the house?",chit-chat
on examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of the bedroom,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find them.,chit-chat
thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the clothes of mr neville st clair with the exception of his coat,novel
"wow, that must have been a lot of fun to do. did you have a good time?",chit-chat
his boots his socks his hat and his watchall were there,novel
that's so funny! i've never seen that before. what was it about?,chit-chat
there were no signs of violence upon any of these garments and there were no other traces of mr neville st clair,novel
i have never heard of mr neville st clair before. what is it about him that you find so interesting?,chit-chat
out of the window he must apparently have gone for no other exit could be discovered and the ominous bloodstains upon the sill gave little promise that he could save himself by swimming for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of the tragedy,novel
that's so sad. i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay.,chit-chat
and now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in the matter,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a fan of evil people.",chit-chat
the lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents but as by mrs st clairs story he was known to have been at the foot of the stair within a very few seconds of her husbands appearance at the window he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime,novel
the lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents but as by mrs. st. clairs story he was know to have been at the foot of the stairs within a very few seconds of her husbands appearance at the window he could hardly have been more than an ory to the crime,chit-chat
his defence was one of absolute ignorance and he protested that he had no knowledge as to the doings of hugh boone his lodger and that he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing gentlemans clothes,novel
that's so sad. i'm glad he didn't have to deal with that.,chit-chat
so much for the lascar manager,novel

that's a good point. i'm not sure what to do with the letter.,chit-chat
probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his who forgot all about it for some days that was it said holmes nodding approvingly i have no doubt of it,novel
"that's a good guess, but i don't think so. i've never heard of holmes before.",chit-chat

a lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the purpose of examination,novel

i am glad to have a friend with whom i can discuss my results,novel
that's great! i'm glad you have a friend that you can talk to.,chit-chat
the matter is a perfectly trivial onehe jerked his thumb in the direction of the old hatbut there are points in connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction i seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his crackling fire for a sharp frost had set in and the windows were thick with the ice crystals,novel
"wow, that's pretty intense. i'm not sure i could do that. what did you do?",chit-chat
i suppose i remarked that homely as it looks this thing has some deadly story linked on to itthat it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the punishment of some crime no no,novel
"i'm not sure what you mean by that, but i hope you're right.",chit-chat

i've never laughed so hard in my life. it's one of my favorite things to do.,chit-chat
only one of those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have four million human beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square miles,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you referring to the fact that there are four million human beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square miles?,chit-chat
amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity every possible combination of events may be expected to take place and many a little problem will be presented which may be striking and bizarre without being criminal,novel

we have already had experience of such so much so i remarked that of the last six cases which i have added to my notes three have been entirely free of any legal crime precisely,novel

i beg that you will look upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual problem,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you saying i should look upon it as a battered billycock?,chit-chat
and first as to how it came here,novel
how did it come to this place? i've never heard of a place like this before.,chit-chat
it arrived upon christmas morning in company with a good fat goose which is i have no doubt roasting at this moment in front of petersons fire,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm sure it's a good goose. what kind of goose is it?,chit-chat
the facts are these about four oclock on christmas morning peterson who as you know is a very honest fellow was returning from some small jollification and was making his way homeward down tottenham court road,novel
"wow, that's crazy. i hope he didn't get hurt or anything like that.",chit-chat
in front of him he saw in the gaslight a tallish man walking with a slight stagger and carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder,novel

as he reached the corner of goodge street a row broke out between this stranger and a little knot of roughs,novel
that must have been scary. did you have to go to the hospital to get it fixed?,chit-chat
one of the latter knocked off the mans hat on which he raised his stick to defend himself and swinging it over his head smashed the shop window behind him,novel
oh no! that's terrible! i hope he's ok. did he get hurt?,chit-chat
peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his assailants but the man shocked at having broken the window and seeing an officiallooking person in uniform rushing towards him dropped his goose took to his heels and vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of tottenham court road,novel
"oh my god, that's so scary! i'm so glad you're okay!",chit-chat
the roughs had also fled at the appearance of peterson so that he was left in possession of the field of battle and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a most unimpeachable christmas goose which surely he restored to their owner my dear fellow there lies the problem,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you are able to find him soon.,chit-chat
it is true that for mrs henry baker was printed upon a small card which was tied to the birds left leg and it is also true that the initials h,novel
that's interesting. i didn't know that. do you have a favorite card?,chit-chat
b are legible upon the lining of this hat but as there are some thousands of bakers and some hundreds of henry bakers in this city of ours it is not easy to restore lost property to any one of them what then did peterson do he brought round both hat and goose to me on christmas morning knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get it restored.,chit-chat
the goose we retained until this morning when there were signs that in spite of the slight frost it would be well that it should be eaten without unnecessary delay,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope it wasn't too bad for you.,chit-chat
its finder has carried it off therefore to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose while i continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who lost his christmas dinner did he not advertise no then what clue could you have as to his identity only as much as we can deduce from his hat precisely but you are joking,novel
i am so sorry to hear that. i hope you are able to find him in the future.,chit-chat
what can you gather from this old battered felt here is my lens,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what do you do for a living? do you have any hobbies?,chit-chat
you know my methods,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you referring to something i've never heard of before?,chit-chat
what can you gather yourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn this article i took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather ruefully,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm sure he's proud of you.,chit-chat
it was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape hard and much the worse for wear,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get it fixed.,chit-chat
the lining had been of red silk but was a good deal discoloured,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never heard of discoloration before. what color was it?,chit-chat
there was no makers name but as holmes had remarked the initials h,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of holmes. what's his name?,chit-chat
b were scrawled upon one side,novel
that's a good way to look at it. what do you think of the other side?,chit-chat
it was pierced in the brim for a hatsecurer but the elastic was missing,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get it fixed.,chit-chat
for the rest it was cracked exceedingly dusty and spotted in several places although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the discoloured patches by smearing them with ink,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of that before. did you find out who did it?,chit-chat
i can see nothing said i handing it back to my friend,novel
that's nice of you. it's always nice to have a friend you can trust.,chit-chat
on the contrary watson you can see everything,novel
"on the contrary watson, you can see everything on the opposite side of the spectrum...",chit-chat
you fail however to reason from what you see,novel
that's a good way to look at it. do you think i should try harder next time?,chit-chat
you are too timid in drawing your inferences then pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat he picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion which was characteristic of him,novel
i don't know what it is. i'm not sure what to do with it.,chit-chat
it is perhaps less suggestive than it might have been he remarked and yet there are a few inferences which are very distinct and a few others which represent at least a strong balance of probability,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure if it was him or not.,chit-chat
that the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the face of it and also that he was fairly welltodo within the last three years although he has now fallen upon evil days,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find peace with him.,chit-chat
he had foresight but has less now than formerly pointing to a moral retrogression which when taken with the decline of his fortunes seems to indicate some evil influence probably drink at work upon him,novel
i don't think so. i think it's more likely that he was drinking at work.,chit-chat
this may account also for the obvious fact that his wife has ceased to love him my dear holmes he has however retained some degree of selfrespect he continued disregarding my remonstrance,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
he is a man who leads a sedentary life goes out little is out of training entirely is middleaged has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days and which he anoints with limecream,novel
"wow, that's pretty intense. i'm sorry to hear that. how long has he been out of training?",chit-chat
these are the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat,novel
i'm not familiar with patent law. what do you mean by deduced from his hat?,chit-chat
also by the way that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid on in his house you are certainly joking holmes not in the least,novel
i don't think it's holmes. i think he's just trying to make a living.,chit-chat
is it possible that even now when i give you these results you are unable to see how they are attained i have no doubt that i am very stupid but i must confess that i am unable to follow you,novel
i don't think so. i'm not sure what you mean. what do you mean by that?,chit-chat
for example how did you deduce that this man was intellectual for answer holmes clapped the hat upon his head,novel
"i don't know about holmes, but i do know that he was a very smart man.",chit-chat
it came right over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose,novel
that's pretty cool. did you have to clean it up or did you just put it back together?,chit-chat
it is a question of cubic capacity said he a man with so large a brain must have something in it the decline of his fortunes then this hat is three years old,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you referring to the hat or the hat itself?,chit-chat
these flat brims curled at the edge came in then,novel
that's a good way to look at it. what do you do for a living?,chit-chat
it is a hat of the very best quality,novel
it really is. i'm so happy i got it. i can't wait to get it.,chit-chat
look at the band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining,novel
"i've never heard of them, but i'll look them up. what's a band of ribbed silk?",chit-chat
if this man could afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago and has had no hat since then he has assuredly gone down in the world well that is clear enough certainly,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you saying that he has gone down in the world?,chit-chat
but how about the foresight and the moral retrogression sherlock holmes laughed,novel
i don't think i've ever laughed so hard in my life... ever.,chit-chat
here is the foresight said he putting his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hatsecurer,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never seen a hatsecurer before. what does it look like?,chit-chat
they are never sold upon hats,novel
"that's true, but i'm not sure if i'll ever get one.",chit-chat
if this man ordered one it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight since he went out of his way to take this precaution against the wind,novel
i think you're right. i'm glad he didn't order one though.,chit-chat
but since we see that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace it it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think of it that way. i'm glad he's doing better now.,chit-chat
on the other hand he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink which is a sign that he has not entirely lost his selfrespect your reasoning is certainly plausible the further points that he is middleaged that his hair is grizzled that it has been recently cut and that he uses limecream are all to be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining,novel
that's a very interesting theory. i'm not sure i've ever heard of limecream before.,chit-chat
the lens discloses a large number of hairends clean cut by the scissors of the barber,novel
i've never had a haircut like that before. how long did it take you to get it done?,chit-chat
they all appear to be adhesive and there is a distinct odour of limecream,novel
i don't think i've ever heard of limecream. what is it?,chit-chat
this dust you will observe is not the gritty grey dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer perspired very freely and could therefore hardly be in the best of training but his wifeyou said that she had ceased to love him this hat has not been brushed for weeks,novel
"oh my god, that's awful. i'm so sorry you have to deal with that.",chit-chat
when i see you my dear watson with a weeks accumulation of dust upon your hat and when your wife allows you to go out in such a state i shall fear that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wifes affection but he might be a bachelor nay he was bringing home the goose as a peaceoffering to his wife,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
remember the card upon the birds leg you have an answer to everything,novel
that's a good one. i'll have to remember that. do you have a favorite bird?,chit-chat
but how on earth do you deduce that the gas is not laid on in his house one tallow stain or even two might come by chance but when i see no less than five i think that there can be little doubt that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning tallowwalks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other,novel
that's a good point. i don't know how to deduct gas from him.,chit-chat
anyhow he never got tallowstains from a gasjet,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. do you have any idea why he didn't?,chit-chat
are you satisfied well it is very ingenious said i laughing but since as you said just now there has been no crime committed and no harm done save the loss of a goose all this seems to be rather a waste of energy sherlock holmes had opened his mouth to reply when the door flew open and peterson the commissionaire rushed into the apartment with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment,novel
i'm not satisfied at all. i don't know what to do with myself.,chit-chat

that's interesting. i'm not familiar with that ad. what's it about?,chit-chat
it is absolutely unique and its value can only be conjectured but the reward offered of 1000 is certainly not within a twentieth part of the market price a thousand pounds,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure i'd want to spend that much on something i don't need.,chit-chat
great lord of mercy the commissionaire plumped down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us,novel
that's so cool! i've never seen that movie. what's it about?,chit-chat
that is the reward and i have reason to know that there are sentimental considerations in the background which would induce the countess to part with half her fortune if she could but recover the gem it was lost if i remember aright at the hotel cosmopolitan i remarked,novel
"that's a good point, i didn't think of that. i'll have to remember that for next time.",chit-chat

so now we must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and ascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. what part of the little mystery do you mean?,chit-chat
to do this we must try the simplest means first and these lie undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers,novel
that's a good idea. i'm not sure if i can do that though.,chit-chat
if this fail i shall have recourse to other methods what will you say give me a pencil and that slip of paper,novel
i'll give you a pencil and a slip of paper. what will you say to me?,chit-chat

"i've never heard of him, but i'll look him up. is he a good baker?",chit-chat
but will he see it well he is sure to keep an eye on the papers since to a poor man the loss was a heavy one,novel
i'm sure he will. it's been a long time since i've lost a loved one.,chit-chat
he was clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of peterson that he thought of nothing but flight but since then he must have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his bird,novel
that's a good point. i'm glad he didn't break the window.,chit-chat
then again the introduction of his name will cause him to see it for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to it,novel
that's what i'm worried about. i don't know what to do.,chit-chat
here you are peterson run down to the advertising agency and have this put in the evening papers in which sir oh in the _globe_ _star_ _pall mall_ _st,novel

you're welcome. i'm glad you like it. i hope you enjoy it.,chit-chat
and i say peterson just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here with me for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your family is now devouring when the commissionaire had gone holmes took up the stone and held it against the light,novel
"wow, that's intense. i'm not sure i could do that. i don't think i could handle that.",chit-chat
its a bonny thing said he,novel

every good stone is,novel
"that's true, but i'm not sure if it's a good stone.",chit-chat
they are the devils pet baits,novel
"yes, they are. i'm not sure if i'll ever get another one.",chit-chat
in the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed,novel
that's a good way to look at it. do you have any experience with cars?,chit-chat
this stone is not yet twenty years old,novel
it's not? what's it for? i've never seen it before.,chit-chat
it was found in the banks of the amoy river in southern china and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the carbuncle save that it is blue in shade instead of ruby red,novel
"wow, that's amazing! i've never seen it before, but i'd love to see it.",chit-chat
in spite of its youth it has already a sinister history,novel

there have been two murders a vitriolthrowing a suicide and several robberies brought about for the sake of this fortygrain weight of crystallised charcoal,novel
"wow, that's crazy. i've never heard of a vitriolthrowing a suicide.",chit-chat
who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows and the prison,novel
"i don't know, but i'm glad they didn't get rid of it.",chit-chat
ill lock it up in my strong box now and drop a line to the countess to say that we have it do you think that this man horner is innocent i can not tell well then do you imagine that this other one henry baker had anything to do with the matter it is i think much more likely that henry baker is an absolutely innocent man who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a fan of horner.",chit-chat
that however i shall determine by a very simple test if we have an answer to our advertisement and you can do nothing until then nothing in that case i shall continue my professional round,novel

i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get it resolved.,chit-chat
as i approached the house i saw a tall man in a scotch bonnet with a coat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight,novel

ah watson you have just come at the right time,novel
"i know, it's been a long time since i've done anything like that.",chit-chat
is that your hat mr baker yes sir that is undoubtedly my hat he was a large man with rounded shoulders a massive head and a broad intelligent face sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown,novel
i'm not sure what you're talking about. are you talking about a man with a grizzled brown beard?,chit-chat
a touch of red in nose and cheeks with a slight tremor of his extended hand recalled holmes surmise as to his habits,novel
"i've never heard of holmes, but i'm familiar with him. what do you do for a living?",chit-chat
his rusty black frockcoat was buttoned right up in front with the collar turned up and his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt,novel
that's pretty cool. did he have any other hobbies besides frockcoat?,chit-chat
he spoke in a slow staccato fashion choosing his words with care and gave the impression generally of a man of learning and letters who had had illusage at the hands of fortune,novel
i love staccato fashion. it is one of the most popular fashion brands in the world.,chit-chat
we have retained these things for some days said holmes because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your address,novel
that's very nice of you. it's nice that you have such a great customer service.,chit-chat
i am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh,novel
"i don't know, maybe i should have. maybe i'll do that next time.",chit-chat
shillings have not been so plentiful with me as they once were he remarked,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did he do to make you feel that way?,chit-chat
i had no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the bird,novel
i'm so sorry that happened to you. i hope you're okay. what did you do?,chit-chat
i did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering them very naturally,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get back on your feet soon.,chit-chat
by the way about the bird we were compelled to eat it to eat it our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement,novel
that's so cute! what kind of bird is it? i've never seen a bird like that before.,chit-chat
yes it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so,novel
that's what i'm thinking. i don't know what to do with myself.,chit-chat
but i presume that this other goose upon the sideboard which is about the same weight and perfectly fresh will answer your purpose equally well oh certainly certainly answered mr baker with a sigh of relief,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you referring to the other goose?,chit-chat
of course we still have the feathers legs crop and so on of your own bird so if you wish the man burst into a hearty laugh,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a fan of laughing at my own jokes.",chit-chat
they might be useful to me as relics of my adventure said he but beyond that i can hardly see what use the _disjecta membra_ of my late acquaintance are going to be to me,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what do you do for a living? do you have any hobbies?,chit-chat
no sir i think that with your permission i will confine my attentions to the excellent bird which i perceive upon the sideboard sherlock holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his shoulders,novel
"haha, that's funny. i'm not sure what sherlock holmes looks like.",chit-chat
there is your hat then and there your bird said he,novel
that's so funny! i've never heard that before. what is it about?,chit-chat
by the way would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from,novel
i got it from a friend of mine. i'm not sure where it came from.,chit-chat

my pence were duly paid and the rest is familiar to you,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do to make it familiar to you?,chit-chat
i am much indebted to you sir for a scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity with a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and strode off upon his way,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get it fixed.,chit-chat
so much for mr henry baker said holmes when he had closed the door behind him,novel
what did he say? i've never heard of him before. what was he saying?,chit-chat
it is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about the matter,novel
that's what i'm thinking. it's like he doesn't even know what he's talking about.,chit-chat
are you hungry watson not particularly then i suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow up this clue while it is still hot by all means it was a bitter night so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats about our throats,novel
that's a great idea! i'm going to have to try that. i've never done that before.,chit-chat
outside the stars were shining coldly in a cloudless sky and the breath of the passersby blew out into smoke like so many pistol shots,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get back to work soon.,chit-chat

"oh wow, that must have been a long time ago. did you have a good time?",chit-chat
holmes pushed open the door of the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from the ruddyfaced whiteaproned landlord,novel
holmes pushed the door open the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from the ruddyfaced whiteaproned landlord,chit-chat

goodnight now for mr breckinridge he continued buttoning up his coat as we came out into the frosty air,novel
that's so funny! what did you do about it? did you call the police?,chit-chat
remember watson that though we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain we have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years penal servitude unless we can establish his innocence,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a fan of innocent until proven guilty.",chit-chat
it is possible that our inquiry may but confirm his guilt but in any case we have a line of investigation which has been missed by the police and which a singular chance has placed in our hands,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure if it's true or not.,chit-chat
let us follow it out to the bitter end,novel
that's what i'm going to do. i don't know what to do with myself.,chit-chat

i don't know what i'm going to do. it's not going to happen.,chit-chat
but im always ready to back my opinion on a matter of fowls and i have a fiver on it that the bird i ate is country bred well then youve lost your fiver for its town bred snapped the salesman,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i don't think i could do that.,chit-chat
its nothing of the kind i say it is i dont believe it dyou think you know more about fowls than i who have handled them ever since i was a nipper,novel
"i don't know much about them, but i do know that they are native to the americas.",chit-chat
i tell you all those birds that went to the alpha were town bred youll never persuade me to believe that will you bet then its merely taking your money for i know that i am right,novel
that's a good way to look at it. it's hard to tell sometimes.,chit-chat

the adventure of the speckled band on glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which i have during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend sherlock holmes i find many tragic some comic a large number merely strange but none commonplace for working as he did rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of wealth he refused to associate himself with any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual and even the fantastic,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i've never heard of the speckled band before. what's their name?",chit-chat

i have never heard of a banda speckled band. what is one of them?,chit-chat
i do not know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which she used holmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied,novel

it seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business dark enough and sinister enough yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are sound and that the door window and chimney are impassable then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious end what becomes then of these nocturnal whistles and what of the very peculiar words of the dying woman i can not think when you combine the ideas of whistles at night the presence of a band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor the fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an interest in preventing his stepdaughters marriage the dying allusion to a band and finally the fact that miss helen stoner heard a metallic clang which might have been caused by one of those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its place i think that there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along those lines but what then did the gipsies do i can not imagine i see many objections to any such theory and so do i,novel
"i don't know much about the doctor, but i do know that there is no evidence that he did anything to her.",chit-chat

that's awful. i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she's okay.,chit-chat
to determine its exact meaning i have been obliged to work out the present prices of the investments with which it is concerned,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what do you plan to do with the money if you don't mind me asking?,chit-chat
the total income which at the time of the wifes death was little short of 1100 is now through the fall in agricultural prices not more than 750,novel
"wow, that's a lot of money. i'm sorry to hear about your wifes death.",chit-chat
each daughter can claim an income of 250 in case of marriage,novel
that's good to know. i didn't know that. i'll have to look into that.,chit-chat
it is evident therefore that if both girls had married this beauty would have had a mere pittance while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent,novel
i don't know... i think it's a little too much for me.,chit-chat
my mornings work has not been wasted since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort,novel
that's good to hear. i'm glad you're feeling better about it.,chit-chat
and now watson this is too serious for dawdling especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs so if you are ready we shall call a cab and drive to waterloo,novel
i'm not sure if i'd want to drive to waterloo. it's a bit far for me.,chit-chat
i should be very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your pocket,novel
that's a good idea. i'll have to think about that. what kind of gun do you have?,chit-chat
an eleys no,novel
i've never heard of an eleys before. what's the name of it?,chit-chat
2 is an excellent argument with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots,novel
i'm not sure what you're talking about. are you talking about something else?,chit-chat
that and a toothbrush are i think all that we need at waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for leatherhead where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five miles through the lovely surrey lanes,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. i'm glad you were able to do that.,chit-chat
it was a perfect day with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens,novel
that sounds like a wonderful day! i'm glad you had a good day. what did you do for fun?,chit-chat
the trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots and the air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth,novel
i love the smell of the moist earth. it reminds me of summer time when i was a kid.,chit-chat
to me at least there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged,novel
that's a good way to look at it. how long did it take for you to get engaged?,chit-chat
my companion sat in the front of the trap his arms folded his hat pulled down over his eyes and his chin sunk upon his breast buried in the deepest thought,novel
"wow, that must have been quite an experience. what did you do to make him feel better?",chit-chat
suddenly however he started tapped me on the shoulder and pointed over the meadows,novel
oh no! what did you do? did you tell him to get out of the way?,chit-chat
look there said he,novel
what did he say? i can't seem to find it. i'll have to look for it.,chit-chat
a heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope thickening into a grove at the highest point,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. what did you do to make it more fun for you?,chit-chat
from amid the branches there jutted out the grey gables and high rooftree of a very old mansion,novel
that's really cool. i've always wanted to go to a mansion like that.,chit-chat
stoke moran said he,novel
"i don't know what that means, but i'm not sure what it means.",chit-chat
yes sir that be the house of dr grimesby roylott remarked the driver,novel
i've never heard of him. i'll have to look him up. do you know who he is?,chit-chat
there is some building going on there said holmes that is where we are going theres the village said the driver pointing to a cluster of roofs some distance to the left but if you want to get to the house youll find it shorter to get over this stile and so by the footpath over the fields,novel
"that's a good idea, i'll have to try that. thanks for the advice!",chit-chat
there it is where the lady is walking and the lady i fancy is miss stoner observed holmes shading his eyes,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of miss stoner. what does she look like?,chit-chat
yes i think we had better do as you suggest we got off paid our fare and the trap rattled back on its way to leatherhead,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get back on your feet soon.,chit-chat
i thought it as well said holmes as we climbed the stile that this fellow should think we had come here as architects or on some definite business,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad you were able to get to the stile.,chit-chat
it may stop his gossip,novel
that's what i'm thinking. i don't know what to do about it.,chit-chat
goodafternoon miss stoner,novel
have you ever heard of goodafternoon miss stoner? it's a song by the same name.,chit-chat
you see that we have been as good as our word our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face which spoke her joy,novel
that's really nice of her. i'm glad you were able to meet her.,chit-chat
i have been waiting so eagerly for you she cried shaking hands with us warmly,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you guys have a good time together.,chit-chat
all has turned out splendidly,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope everything turns out well for you and your family.,chit-chat
dr roylott has gone to town and it is unlikely that he will be back before evening we have had the pleasure of making the doctors acquaintance said holmes and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope everything turns out well for you and your family.,chit-chat
miss stoner turned white to the lips as she listened,novel
i love miss stoner! she's such a great singer and songwriter. do you like her music?,chit-chat
good heavens she cried he has followed me then so it appears he is so cunning that i never know when i am safe from him,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get away from him.,chit-chat
what will he say when he returns he must guard himself for he may find that there is someone more cunning than himself upon his track,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure what he's going to say.,chit-chat
you must lock yourself up from him tonight,novel
i sure hope so. i don't think i'll be able to sleep tonight.,chit-chat
if he is violent we shall take you away to your aunts at harrow,novel
"i'm not sure if he's violent or not, but i don't want to hurt him.",chit-chat
now we must make the best use of our time so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to examine the building was of grey lichenblotched stone with a high central portion and two curving wings like the claws of a crab thrown out on each side,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun! i'm sure you'll have a great time!,chit-chat
in one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards while the roof was partly caved in a picture of ruin,novel
"wow, that must have been a scary experience for you. i'm glad you're okay.",chit-chat
the central portion was in little better repair but the righthand block was comparatively modern and the blinds in the windows with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys showed that this was where the family resided,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get it fixed.,chit-chat
some scaffolding had been erected against the end wall and the stonework had been broken into but there were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit,novel
"wow, that's scary. i hope you didn't have to go to the hospital.",chit-chat
holmes walked slowly up and down the illtrimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the outsides of the windows,novel
"hey holmes, how are you doing today? i just got back from a walk in the park.",chit-chat
this i take it belongs to the room in which you used to sleep the centre one to your sisters and the one next to the main building to dr roylotts chamber exactly so,novel
that's a great idea! i'll have to look into that. i've never been to dr roylotts.,chit-chat
but i am now sleeping in the middle one pending the alterations as i understand,novel
"i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're feeling better now, though.",chit-chat
by the way there does not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall there were none,novel
that's what i was thinking. i'm not sure what to do with it.,chit-chat
i believe that it was an excuse to move me from my room ah,novel
why did you move from your room? did you have to move to a new place or something?,chit-chat
that is suggestive,novel
it's been a long time since i've done anything like that. i don't think i'll ever be able to do it again.,chit-chat
now on the other side of this narrow wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open,novel
that's awesome! i'm glad you're able to do something like that.,chit-chat
there are windows in it of course yes but very small ones,novel
"yes, they are very small. i'll have to look for them next time i'm there.",chit-chat
too narrow for anyone to pass through as you both locked your doors at night your rooms were unapproachable from that side,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think of that. i'll have to think about that.,chit-chat
now would you have the kindness to go into your room and bar your shutters miss stoner did so and holmes after a careful examination through the open window endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open but without success,novel
i would have the kindness to go into my room and bar your shutters miss stoner did so and holmes after a careful examination through the open window endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open but without success,chit-chat
there was no slit through which a knife could be passed to raise the bar,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of that before. what type of knife was it?,chit-chat
then with his lens he tested the hinges but they were of solid iron built firmly into the massive masonry,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad he didn't have to do that.,chit-chat
hum said he scratching his chin in some perplexity my theory certainly presents some difficulties,novel
i don't think i've ever had a problem with scratching my chin...,chit-chat
no one could pass these shutters if they were bolted,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure i'd be able to do it.,chit-chat
well we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the matter a small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three bedrooms opened,novel
"oh wow, that's scary! i'm glad you're safe, though.",chit-chat
holmes refused to examine the third chamber so we passed at once to the second that in which miss stoner was now sleeping and in which her sister had met with her fate,novel
"oh wow, that must have been scary. did you find out who she was or what happened?",chit-chat
it was a homely little room with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace after the fashion of old countryhouses,novel
"wow, that must have been a lot of fun. did you have any fun in it?",chit-chat
a brown chest of drawers stood in one corner a narrow whitecounterpaned bed in another and a dressingtable on the lefthand side of the window,novel
"wow, that must have been scary. did you find out who it was or what happened?",chit-chat
these articles with two small wickerwork chairs made up all the furniture in the room save for a square of wilton carpet in the centre,novel
that sounds like a lot of work. i'm sure it's worth it though.,chit-chat
the boards round and the panelling of the walls were of brown wormeaten oak so old and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of the house,novel
that's interesting. do you think it's possible that it is from the past?,chit-chat
holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down taking in every detail of the apartment,novel
that's pretty interesting. did you find out who holmes was or what he was up to?,chit-chat
where does that bell communicate with he asked at last pointing to a thick bellrope which hung down beside the bed the tassel actually lying upon the pillow,novel
"that's a good question. i'm not sure, but i do know that it's hard to tell.",chit-chat
it goes to the housekeepers room it looks newer than the other things yes it was only put there a couple of years ago your sister asked for it i suppose no i never heard of her using it,novel
"yeah, i don't think i've ever seen her use it either. i guess i'll just have to let her borrow it.",chit-chat
we used always to get what we wanted for ourselves indeed it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bellpull there,novel
"that's true. it's nice to get what you want, but sometimes you just don't get it.",chit-chat
you will excuse me for a few minutes while i satisfy myself as to this floor he threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward examining minutely the cracks between the boards,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you didn't have to clean it up.,chit-chat
then he did the same with the woodwork with which the chamber was panelled,novel
that's what i was thinking. i'm glad he didn't do that.,chit-chat
finally he walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall,novel
that's so cute! what did you do to get him out of the bed?!,chit-chat
finally he took the bellrope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug,novel
that's so nice of him. i'm sure he's proud of you.,chit-chat
why its a dummy said he,novel
"i don't know, i'm not sure. i think he's just trying to make me feel better about myself.",chit-chat
wont it ring no it is not even attached to a wire,novel
"it is attached to a wire, but i don't know what to do with it.",chit-chat
this is very interesting,novel
it really is. i'm not sure if i'll be able to do it this year.,chit-chat
you can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little opening for the ventilator is how very absurd,novel
that's what i was thinking. i've never seen a hook like that before.,chit-chat
i never noticed that before very strange muttered holmes pulling at the rope,novel
i didn't notice until you mentioned it. what did he pull at the rope for?,chit-chat
there are one or two very singular points about this room,novel
what do you mean by that? i'm not sure what you're talking about.,chit-chat
for example what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room when with the same trouble he might have communicated with the outside air that is also quite modern said the lady,novel
i'm not sure what you're talking about. are you talking about the guy who opened a vent into another room when with the same trouble he might have communicated with the outside air that is also quite modern said the lady?,chit-chat
done about the same time as the bellrope remarked holmes,novel
i've never heard of that before. what's it like to be a bellrope holmes?,chit-chat
yes there were several little changes carried out about that time they seem to have been of a most interesting characterdummy bellropes and ventilators which do not ventilate,novel
i didn't know that. i'll have to check it out. thanks for the info.,chit-chat
with your permission miss stoner we shall now carry our researches into the inner apartment dr grimesby roylotts chamber was larger than that of his stepdaughter but was as plainly furnished,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun! i'm sure you'll have a great time!,chit-chat
a campbed a small wooden shelf full of books mostly of a technical character an armchair beside the bed a plain wooden chair against the wall a round table and a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye,novel
"wow, that sounds like a lot of fun. what did you do with the iron safe?",chit-chat
holmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the keenest interest,novel
holmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the * * keenest * * interest,chit-chat
whats in here he asked tapping the safe,novel
i don't know... i'm not sure what he's talking about.,chit-chat
my stepfathers business papers oh,novel
what kind of papers did your stepfathers papers have? i'm sorry to hear that.,chit-chat
you have seen inside then only once some years ago,novel
"i've seen it a few times, but i don't know if i'll ever see it again.",chit-chat
i remember that it was full of papers there isnt a cat in it for example no,novel
that's a good one. i've never seen a cat in a paper before.,chit-chat
what a strange idea well look at this he took up a small saucer of milk which stood on the top of it,novel
"wow, that's really strange. i've never seen a milk saucer before.",chit-chat
no we dont keep a cat,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what do you do for a living? do you have any pets?,chit-chat
but there is a cheetah and a baboon ah yes of course,novel
i don't think i've ever seen a cheetah or a baboon.,chit-chat
well a cheetah is just a big cat and yet a saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants i daresay,novel
cheetah is just a big cat and yet a saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants i daresay,chit-chat
there is one point which i should wish to determine he squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it with the greatest attention,novel
that would be so funny! i hope he didn't do that to you...,chit-chat
thank you,novel
you're welcome. i'm glad you like it. i hope you enjoy it.,chit-chat
that is quite settled said he rising and putting his lens in his pocket,novel
that's good to hear. i'm glad he didn't have to do that.,chit-chat
hullo,novel
"hi, how are you today? i just got back from the beach and i'm having a great time.",chit-chat
here is something interesting the object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one corner of the bed,novel
that's really interesting. did you find out who it was? did you call the police?,chit-chat
the lash however was curled upon itself and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of whipcord loops before. what's it like?,chit-chat
what do you make of that watson its a common enough lash,novel
i don't know... i'm not sure what to make of it.,chit-chat
but i dont know why it should be tied that is not quite so common is it,novel
"i don't know why it should be tied, but it's not very common.",chit-chat
ah me,novel
what do you like to do in your spare time? i like to go to the beach.,chit-chat
its a wicked world and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all,novel
i can't imagine what it's like to be in a world like that. i've never been in one before.,chit-chat
i think that i have seen enough now miss stoner and with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn i had never seen my friends face so grim or his brow so dark as it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get away with it.,chit-chat
we had walked several times up and down the lawn neither miss stoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his reverie,novel
"aww, that's so sweet of you to do that. what did you do?",chit-chat
it is very essential miss stoner said he that you should absolutely follow my advice in every respect i shall most certainly do so the matter is too serious for any hesitation,novel
that's good advice. it's important to follow your gut and make sure you're doing the right thing.,chit-chat
your life may depend upon your compliance i assure you that i am in your hands in the first place both my friend and i must spend the night in your room both miss stoner and i gazed at him in astonishment,novel
"i'm not sure what you mean by astonishment, but i don't know what that means.",chit-chat
yes it must be so,novel
it really is. it's been a long time since i've been in a relationship.,chit-chat
let me explain,novel
what do you mean? i'm not sure what you're talking about...,chit-chat
i believe that that is the village inn over there yes that is the crown very good,novel
i've never been there before. i'll have to check it out. what's the village inn called?,chit-chat
your windows would be visible from there certainly you must confine yourself to your room on pretence of a headache when your stepfather comes back,novel
that's a good idea. i think i'm going to have to do that.,chit-chat
then when you hear him retire for the night you must open the shutters of your window undo the hasp put your lamp there as a signal to us and then withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to occupy,novel
"haha, that's a great idea. i'll have to try that. thanks for the idea!",chit-chat
i have no doubt that in spite of the repairs you could manage there for one night oh yes easily the rest you will leave in our hands but what will you do we shall spend the night in your room and we shall investigate the cause of this noise which has disturbed you i believe mr holmes that you have already made up your mind said miss stoner laying her hand upon my companions sleeve,novel
i have no doubt that in spite of the repairs you could manage there for one night oh yes easily the rest you will leave in our hands but what will we do we shall spend the night in your room and we shall investigate the cause of this noise which has disturbed you i believe mr holmes that you have already made up your mind said miss stoner laying her hand upon my companions sleeve,chit-chat
perhaps i have then for pitys sake tell me what was the cause of my sisters death i should prefer to have clearer proofs before i speak you can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct and if she died from some sudden fright no i do not think so,novel
i'm so sorry to hear about your sisters death. i hope you're okay.,chit-chat
i think that there was probably some more tangible cause,novel
"i don't think so. i'm not sure what caused it, but it's been a while since i've seen it.",chit-chat
and now miss stoner we must leave you for if dr roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain,novel
i've never heard of miss stoner. what's she up to these days?,chit-chat
goodbye and be brave for if you will do what i have told you you may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you sherlock holmes and i had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and sittingroom at the crown inn,novel
that's a good idea. i'll be sure to do that. thank you.,chit-chat
they were on the upper floor and from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate and of the inhabited wing of stoke moran manor house,novel
that must have been scary! did you find out who it was? did you report it to the police?,chit-chat
at dusk we saw dr grimesby roylott drive past his huge form looming up beside the little figure of the lad who drove him,novel
that's pretty cool. did you get to see him in person or did you watch the movie?,chit-chat
the boy had some slight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates and we heard the hoarse roar of the doctors voice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad he was able to get it under control.,chit-chat
the trap drove on and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sittingrooms,novel
that's scary! did you find out who it was? did you call the police?,chit-chat
do you know watson said holmes as we sat together in the gathering darkness i have really some scruples as to taking you tonight,novel
"i don't know what you mean by scruples, but i'm not sure what that means.",chit-chat
there is a distinct element of danger can i be of assistance your presence might be invaluable then i shall certainly come it is very kind of you you speak of danger,novel
"that's very kind of you to say, but i'm not sure i can do that.",chit-chat
you have evidently seen more in these rooms than was visible to me no but i fancy that i may have deduced a little more,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i don't think i've ever seen more than one room.,chit-chat
i imagine that you saw all that i did i saw nothing remarkable save the bellrope and what purpose that could answer i confess is more than i can imagine you saw the ventilator too yes but i do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a small opening between two rooms,novel
i don't think it's unusual at all. i'm glad you think so.,chit-chat
it was so small that a rat could hardly pass through i knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to stoke moran my dear holmes oh yes i did,novel
oh no! i'm so sorry to hear that. what did you do about it?,chit-chat
you remember in her statement she said that her sister could smell dr roylotts cigar,novel
oh really? that's interesting. i don't think i've ever smelled a dr. roylotts before.,chit-chat
now of course that suggested at once that there must be a communication between the two rooms,novel
that's what i was thinking. i'm not sure what to do with myself.,chit-chat
it could only be a small one or it would have been remarked upon at the coroners inquiry,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think of that. i'll have to think about that.,chit-chat
i deduced a ventilator but what harm can there be in that well there is at least a curious coincidence of dates,novel
i don't know... i'm not sure. i guess i'll just have to wait and see.,chit-chat
a ventilator is made a cord is hung and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies,novel
that's sad. i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay.,chit-chat
does not that strike you i can not as yet see any connection did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed no it was clamped to the floor,novel
i don't think it's connected to the bed. i think i'm going to have to get a new one.,chit-chat
did you ever see a bed fastened like that before i can not say that i have the lady could not move her bed,novel
"no, i've never seen a bed fastened like that before. i'm sorry to hear that.",chit-chat
it must always be in the same relative position to the ventilator and to the ropeor so we may call it since it was clearly never meant for a bellpull holmes i cried i seem to see dimly what you are hinting at,novel
i don't know what i'm hinting at. it's just frustrating.,chit-chat
we are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime subtle enough and horrible enough,novel
that's a good attitude to have. i'm glad you're doing something about it.,chit-chat
when a doctor does go wrong he is the first of criminals,novel
i'm not sure i follow. are you saying that he's the first to go wrong?,chit-chat
he has nerve and he has knowledge,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm sure he has a lot of knowledge.,chit-chat
palmer and pritchard were among the heads of their profession,novel
i'm not familiar with pritchard's profession. what do you know about him?,chit-chat
this man strikes even deeper but i think watson that we shall be able to strike deeper still,novel
i don't know about that. i think he's going to have a great season.,chit-chat
but we shall have horrors enough before the night is over for goodness sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more cheerful about nine oclock the light among the trees was extinguished and all was dark in the direction of the manor house,novel
i'm sorry you had to go through that. i hope you're okay now.,chit-chat
two hours passed slowly away and then suddenly just at the stroke of eleven a single bright light shone out right in front of us,novel
oh no! that must have been so scary! did you have to go to the hospital?,chit-chat
that is our signal said holmes springing to his feet it comes from the middle window as we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord explaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance and that it was possible that we might spend the night there,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad you were able to get out of the house.,chit-chat
a moment later we were out on the dark road a chill wind blowing in our faces and one yellow light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand,novel
"oh wow, that must have been scary! what did you do after the wind blew in your face and one yellow light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand?",chit-chat
there was little difficulty in entering the grounds for unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall,novel
"wow, that must have been a lot of work. did you have to go to the park?",chit-chat
making our way among the trees we reached the lawn crossed it and were about to enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted child who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness,novel
"oh my god, that's so scary! i'm so sorry you had to go through that.",chit-chat
my god i whispered did you see it holmes was for the moment as startled as i,novel
"no, i did not see it, but i did hear it on the radio. what did you hear?",chit-chat
his hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation,novel
oh that's so sweet. i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do?,chit-chat
then he broke into a low laugh and put his lips to my ear,novel
oh no! what did you do? did you tell him to get out of the house?,chit-chat
it is a nice household he murmured,novel
"it's a nice house, but i'm not sure i could live with him.",chit-chat
that is the baboon i had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected,novel
"oh no, i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay.",chit-chat
there was a cheetah too perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any moment,novel
cheetah? what does that mean? i've never heard of it. what does it mean?,chit-chat
i confess that i felt easier in my mind when after following holmes example and slipping off my shoes i found myself inside the bedroom,novel
that's interesting. did you find out who did it or did you just find out?,chit-chat
my companion noiselessly closed the shutters moved the lamp onto the table and cast his eyes round the room,novel
oh no! that must have been scary! did you find out who did it or what?,chit-chat
all was as we had seen it in the daytime,novel
what did you see in the daytime? i've never seen anything like that before in my life.,chit-chat
then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that i could do to distinguish the words the least sound would be fatal to our plans i nodded to show that i had heard,novel
"wow, that's really creepy. i'm glad you were able to distinguish the words.",chit-chat
we must sit without light,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. have you ever been in a situation where you had to sit without light?,chit-chat
he would see it through the ventilator i nodded again,novel
that's a good way to look at it. what did you say to him about it?,chit-chat
do not go asleep your very life may depend upon it,novel
i don't think so. i think i'm going to stay up all night.,chit-chat
have your pistol ready in case we should need it,novel
"i do, but i'm not sure if i'll be able to find it.",chit-chat
i will sit on the side of the bed and you in that chair i took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table,novel
"that's nice of you to do, but i don't think i could do that.",chit-chat
holmes had brought up a long thin cane and this he placed upon the bed beside him,novel
that's pretty cool. did you find out who he was or what he was up to?,chit-chat
by it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never done that before. how long have you been doing that?,chit-chat
then he turned down the lamp and we were left in darkness,novel
oh no! did you find out who did it or did you have to call the police?,chit-chat
how shall i ever forget that dreadful vigil,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're doing better now. what happened?,chit-chat
i could not hear a sound not even the drawing of a breath and yet i knew that my companion sat openeyed within a few feet of me in the same state of nervous tension in which i was myself,novel
oh no! that must have been scary! did you find out who it was or what?,chit-chat
the shutters cut off the least ray of light and we waited in absolute darkness,novel
oh no! that's terrible! did you have to go to the hospital or anything?,chit-chat
from outside came the occasional cry of a nightbird and once at our very window a long drawn catlike whine which told us that the cheetah was indeed at liberty,novel
"i love cheetah's, they're my favorite. do you like them?",chit-chat
far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock which boomed out every quarter of an hour,novel
"oh wow, that's pretty cool. i've never heard of parish clock before.",chit-chat
how long they seemed those quarters,novel
it was a long time ago. i don't think i'm going to do it again.,chit-chat
twelve struck and one and two and three and still we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. do you live in an area with a lot of storms?,chit-chat
suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator which vanished immediately but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal,novel
"wow, that's scary! i hope you were able to get out of there quickly.",chit-chat
someone in the next room had lit a darklantern,novel
"oh no, that's terrible. what did they do to the darklantern? did you find out who did it?",chit-chat
i heard a gentle sound of movement and then all was silent once more though the smell grew stronger,novel
that's awesome! i'm glad you didn't have to hear it again.,chit-chat
for half an hour i sat with straining ears,novel
oh no! i hope you didn't have to go to the hospital or anything like that.,chit-chat
then suddenly another sound became audiblea very gentle soothing sound like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle,novel
that's so funny! i've never heard of that before. what's it like?,chit-chat
the instant that we heard it holmes sprang from the bed struck a match and lashed furiously with his cane at the bellpull,novel
"oh wow, that must have been scary. did holmes have any other injuries from the match?",chit-chat
you see it watson he yelled,novel
i don't think i've ever yelled at a tv before. what did he say?,chit-chat
you see it but i saw nothing,novel
that's a good thing. i'm glad you didn't see anything. what did you see?,chit-chat
at the moment when holmes struck the light i heard a low clear whistle but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed so savagely,novel
"oh my god, that's so scary! i'm so sorry you had to experience that!",chit-chat
i could however see that his face was deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i don't think i could do that.,chit-chat
he had ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which i have ever listened,novel
"oh no, i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope he's okay.",chit-chat
it swelled up louder and louder a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
they say that away down in the village and even in the distant parsonage that cry raised the sleepers from their beds,novel
that's so sad. i'm sorry to hear that. do you have any siblings?,chit-chat
it struck cold to our hearts and i stood gazing at holmes and he at me until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose,novel
that's so sad. i'm sorry to hear that. what happened to holmes?,chit-chat
what can it mean i gasped,novel
what can it mean to you? what is it that you are excited about? what do you do for fun?,chit-chat
it means that it is all over holmes answered,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i didn't think of that.,chit-chat
and perhaps after all it is for the best,novel
i hope so. it's been a long time since i've been in a relationship.,chit-chat
take your pistol and we will enter dr roylotts room with a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. how long have you been playing dr. roylotts?,chit-chat
twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within,novel
oh no! that's terrible! did you have to call the police to get him back?,chit-chat
then he turned the handle and entered i at his heels with the cocked pistol in my hand,novel
oh no! i hope you didn't get hurt. i've had that happen to me before.,chit-chat
it was a singular sight which met our eyes,novel
that's pretty cool. what did you do to make it look like you saw it?,chit-chat
on the table stood a darklantern with the shutter half open throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe the door of which was ajar,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never heard of ajar. what's his name?,chit-chat
beside this table on the wooden chair sat dr grimesby roylott clad in a long grey dressinggown his bare ankles protruding beneath and his feet thrust into red heelless turkish slippers,novel
"wow, that must have been a long time ago. did you find out who he was?",chit-chat
across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day,novel
that's a good way to look at it. how long did it take you to notice?,chit-chat
his chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band with brownish speckles which seemed to be bound tightly round his head,novel
"wow, that's interesting. did you find out who did it or was it just a coincidence?",chit-chat
as we entered he made neither sound nor motion,novel
that's a bummer. what did he do to make you think he made sound or motion?,chit-chat
the band,novel
have you heard of the band called the band? they are an american rock band formed in 1981.,chit-chat
the speckled band whispered holmes,novel
i've never heard of the speckled band. i'll have to check them out.,chit-chat
i took a step forward,novel
that's great! what did you do to make it a step forward in the first place?,chit-chat
in an instant his strange headgear began to move and there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamondshaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent,novel
"oh my god, i can't even imagine what that must have been like...",chit-chat
it is a swamp adder cried holmes the deadliest snake in india,novel
i've never heard of a deadliest snake in india. what does it look like?,chit-chat
he has died within ten seconds of being bitten,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to take care of him.,chit-chat
violence does in truth recoil upon the violent and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure if i can agree with that.,chit-chat
let us thrust this creature back into its den and we can then remove miss stoner to some place of shelter and let the county police know what has happened as he spoke he drew the dogwhip swiftly from the dead mans lap and throwing the noose round the reptiles neck he drew it from its horrid perch and carrying it at arms length threw it into the iron safe which he closed upon it,novel
"wow, that's intense. i'm sorry you had to go through that. what did you do?",chit-chat
such are the true facts of the death of dr grimesby roylott of stoke moran,novel
"i've never heard of stoke moran, but i'm familiar with him. what's his name?",chit-chat
it is not necessary that i should prolong a narrative which has already run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl how we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at harrow of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet,novel
"wow, that's a long story. what kind of pet did the doctor play with?",chit-chat
the little which i had yet to learn of the case was told me by sherlock holmes as we travelled back next day,novel
"oh wow, that's really interesting. did you find out who it was by chance?",chit-chat
i had said he come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which shows my dear watson how dangerous it always is to reason from insufficient data,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm sure you're right.,chit-chat
the presence of the gipsies and the use of the word band which was used by the poor girl no doubt to explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
i can only claim the merit that i instantly reconsidered my position when however it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door,novel
"oh wow, that's scary! i'm glad you were able to reconsider your position.",chit-chat
my attention was speedily drawn as i have already remarked to you to this ventilator and to the bellrope which hung down to the bed,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you end up doing to get to the bellrope?,chit-chat
the discovery that this was a dummy and that the bed was clamped to the floor instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as a bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed,novel
"oh wow, that's really interesting. did you find out who did it or who found it?",chit-chat
the idea of a snake instantly occurred to me and when i coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from india i felt that i was probably on the right track,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i've never heard of a snake before. what kind of creatures?",chit-chat
the idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an eastern training,novel
i'm not familiar with the eastern training. what is it about eastern training that you're familiar with?,chit-chat
the rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would also from his point of view be an advantage,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think of that. i'll have to think about that.,chit-chat
it would be a sharpeyed coroner indeed who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where the poison fangs had done their work,novel
that's a great idea! i've never thought of that before. i'll have to think about it.,chit-chat
then i thought of the whistle,novel
what whistle? i don't know what you're talking about. what did you think of?,chit-chat
of course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim,novel
that's what i'm thinking. i don't know what to do now.,chit-chat
he had trained it probably by the use of the milk which we saw to return to him when summoned,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think of that. it makes sense.,chit-chat
he would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he thought best with the certainty that it would crawl down the rope and land on the bed,novel
"wow, that's impressive. what did he do to get it through the ventilator?",chit-chat
it might or might not bite the occupant perhaps she might escape every night for a week but sooner or later she must fall a victim,novel
that's what i'm worried about. i don't know what to do.,chit-chat
i had come to these conclusions before ever i had entered his room,novel
why did you enter his room? did you think he was going to do something illegal or something?,chit-chat
an inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on it which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he didn't do that.,chit-chat
the sight of the safe the saucer of milk and the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained,novel
"i've never heard of whipcord, but i'm familiar with the saucer of milk.",chit-chat
the metallic clang heard by miss stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope it wasn't too bad for her.,chit-chat
having once made up my mind you know the steps which i took in order to put the matter to the proof,novel
that's a good way to put it. what steps did you take to put the matter to the proof?,chit-chat
i heard the creature hiss as i have no doubt that you did also and i instantly lit the light and attacked it with the result of driving it through the ventilator and also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the other side,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad you didn't do anything to it.,chit-chat
some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its snakish temper so that it flew upon the first person it saw,novel
that must have been scary! did you have to get it checked out by a doctor or anything?,chit-chat
in this way i am no doubt indirectly responsible for dr grimesby roylotts death and i can not say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my conscience ix,novel
i don't know much about grimesby roylotts. who is he?,chit-chat
the adventure of the engineers thumb of all the problems which have been submitted to my friend mr sherlock holmes for solution during the years of our intimacy there were only two which i was the means of introducing to his noticethat of mr hatherleys thumb and that of colonel warburtons madness,novel
i've never heard of the adventure of the engineers thumb. what's it about?,chit-chat
of these the latter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and original observer but the other was so strange in its inception and so dramatic in its details that it may be the more worthy of being placed upon record even if it gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive methods of reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results,novel
that's really interesting. i've never heard of a deductive method of reasoning before.,chit-chat
the story has i believe been told more than once in the newspapers but like all such narratives its effect is much less striking when set forth _en bloc_ in a single halfcolumn of print than when the facts slowly evolve before your own eyes and the mystery clears gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which leads on to the complete truth,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm not sure i agree with that.,chit-chat
at the time the circumstances made a deep impression upon me and the lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the effect,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're feeling better now. what happened?,chit-chat
it was in the summer of 89 not long after my marriage that the events occurred which i am now about to summarise,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. how long did it take for you to get over it?,chit-chat
i had returned to civil practice and had finally abandoned holmes in his baker street rooms although i continually visited him and occasionally even persuaded him to forgo his bohemian habits so far as to come and visit us,novel
"wow, that's pretty cool. did you find out who he was or what he was up to?",chit-chat
my practice had steadily increased and as i happened to live at no very great distance from paddington station i got a few patients from among the officials,novel
that's great! i'm glad you were able to get some help from the officials.,chit-chat
one of these whom i had cured of a painful and lingering disease was never weary of advertising my virtues and of endeavouring to send me on every sufferer over whom he might have any influence,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. how long did it take for you to cure it?,chit-chat
one morning at a little before seven oclock i was awakened by the maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come from paddington and were waiting in the consultingroom,novel
"oh my goodness, that must have been so scary! did you find out who did it?",chit-chat
i dressed hurriedly for i knew by experience that railway cases were seldom trivial and hastened downstairs,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you didn't get hurt too badly.,chit-chat
as i descended my old ally the guard came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him,novel
oh no! what did he do? did you have to get out of the room to get in?,chit-chat
ive got him here he whispered jerking his thumb over his shoulder hes all right what is it then i asked for his manner suggested that it was some strange creature which he had caged up in my room,novel
"wow, that's creepy. what did you say to him? did he say anything?",chit-chat
its a new patient he whispered,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never seen a patient like that before. what's the patient's name?,chit-chat
i thought id bring him round myself then he couldnt slip away,novel
that's a good thing to do. i'm sure he'll come around.,chit-chat
there he is all safe and sound,novel
"yes, he is. i'm so happy for him. he's such a good person.",chit-chat
i must go now doctor i have my dooties just the same as you and off he went this trusty tout without even giving me time to thank him,novel
that's so nice of him. i'm sure he's a great doctor.,chit-chat
i entered my consultingroom and found a gentleman seated by the table,novel
"oh wow, that must have been so exciting! did you get to see him in person?",chit-chat
he was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books,novel
that's pretty funny. did you find out who he was or what he was up to?,chit-chat
round one of his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped which was mottled all over with bloodstains,novel
"oh wow, that's pretty gross. i'm glad he didn't have to clean it up.",chit-chat
he was young not more than fiveandtwenty i should say with a strong masculine face but he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression of a man who was suffering from some strong agitation which it took all his strength of mind to control,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did he do to make you feel that way?,chit-chat
i am sorry to knock you up so early doctor said he but i have had a very serious accident during the night,novel
"oh no, i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay.",chit-chat
i came in by train this morning and on inquiring at paddington as to where i might find a doctor a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here,novel
that's really nice of you. i'm sure you'll find a good doctor.,chit-chat
i gave the maid a card but i see that she has left it upon the sidetable i took it up and glanced at it,novel
that's a good way to look at it. what did you do with the card?,chit-chat
mr,novel
have you ever heard of mr. robot? it's a tv series based on mr. mr. universe.,chit-chat
victor hatherley hydraulic engineer 16a victoria street 3rd floor that was the name style and abode of my morning visitor,novel
victor hatherley hydraulic engineer 16a victoria street 3rd floor that was the name style and abode my morning visitor,chit-chat
i regret that i have kept you waiting said i sitting down in my librarychair,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. why did you sit down in the chair in the first place?,chit-chat
you are fresh from a night journey i understand which is in itself a monotonous occupation oh my night could not be called monotonous said he and laughed,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad you were able to laugh about it.,chit-chat
he laughed very heartily with a high ringing note leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides,novel
that's really sweet of him. i'm glad he was able to laugh about it.,chit-chat
all my medical instincts rose up against that laugh,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
stop it i cried pull yourself together and i poured out some water from a caraffe,novel
oh no! i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay.,chit-chat
it was useless however,novel
that's what i was thinking. i don't know what i'm going to do with it.,chit-chat
he was off in one of those hysterical outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is over and gone,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get through it.,chit-chat
presently he came to himself once more very weary and palelooking,novel
that's so sad. i hope you're able to get him to come back soon.,chit-chat
i have been making a fool of myself he gasped,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
not at all,novel
i don't think i'll ever be able to do it. it's just not my thing.,chit-chat
drink this i dashed some brandy into the water and the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks,novel
oh no! i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're feeling better now.,chit-chat
thats better said he,novel
"yeah, he's a great guy. i'm so proud of him for doing what he did.",chit-chat
and now doctor perhaps you would kindly attend to my thumb or rather to the place where my thumb used to be he unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i don't know if i could handle that.,chit-chat
it gave even my hardened nerves a shudder to look at it,novel
"oh no, what did you look at? i don't know what i'm going to do.",chit-chat
there were four protruding fingers and a horrid red spongy surface where the thumb should have been,novel
oh no! i'm so sorry to hear that. did you have to go to the doctor?,chit-chat
it had been hacked or torn right out from the roots,novel
that's not good. i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do?,chit-chat
good heavens i cried this is a terrible injury,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope it's not too bad for you.,chit-chat
it must have bled considerably yes it did,novel
"yes, it did. i was so grossed out by it. i don't know what to do now.",chit-chat
i fainted when it was done and i think that i must have been senseless for a long time,novel
"oh no, i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're doing better now.",chit-chat
when i came to i found that it was still bleeding so i tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round the wrist and braced it up with a twig excellent,novel
"oh my god, that's terrible! i'm so sorry to hear that. did you have to go to the hospital?",chit-chat

how is that i asked when i had finished,novel

it is evidently trying to your nerves oh no not now,novel
"yeah, it's been a long time since i've been in a relationship. i don't know what i'm going to do.",chit-chat
i shall have to tell my tale to the police but between ourselves if it were not for the convincing evidence of this wound of mine i should be surprised if they believed my statement for it is a very extraordinary one and i have not much in the way of proof with which to back it up and even if they believe me the clues which i can give them are so vague that it is a question whether justice will be done ha cried i if it is anything in the nature of a problem which you desire to see solved i should strongly recommend you to come to my friend mr sherlock holmes before you go to the official police oh i have heard of that fellow answered my visitor and i should be very glad if he would take the matter up though of course i must use the official police as well,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get it resolved.,chit-chat

"wow, that's a long drive. i'm not sure i could do that.",chit-chat
sherlock holmes was as i expected lounging about his sittingroom in his dressinggown reading the agony column of _the times_ and smoking his beforebreakfast pipe which was composed of all the plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day before all carefully dried and collected on the corner of the mantelpiece,novel
sherlock holmes is one of my favorite sherlock holmes novels. it's one of the best novels of all time.,chit-chat

i am so sorry to hear that. i am glad you are feeling better. i hope you feel better soon.,chit-chat
i shall take up as little of your valuable time as possible so i shall start at once upon my peculiar experiences holmes sat in his big armchair with the weary heavylidded expression which veiled his keen and eager nature while i sat opposite to him and we listened in silence to the strange story which our visitor detailed to us,novel
that sounds like a very interesting experience. what was the strange story that your visitor detailed to you?,chit-chat
you must know said he that i am an orphan and a bachelor residing alone in lodgings in london,novel
"oh no, i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're doing better now.",chit-chat

yesterday however just as i was thinking of leaving the office my clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to see me upon business,novel
that's pretty cool. did you get a chance to talk to him after the fact?,chit-chat
he brought up a card too with the name of colonel lysander stark engraved upon it,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never heard of that card before. what's it about?,chit-chat
close at his heels came the colonel himself a man rather over the middle size but of an exceeding thinness,novel
"oh wow, that's pretty cool. did you get to see the colonel's face?",chit-chat
i do not think that i have ever seen so thin a man,novel
i don't think that i have ever seen so thin a man... lol,chit-chat
his whole face sharpened away into nose and chin and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over his outstanding bones,novel
"oh wow, that's pretty impressive. did he have a lot of health problems like that?",chit-chat
yet this emaciation seemed to be his natural habit and due to no disease for his eye was bright his step brisk and his bearing assured,novel
i'm glad he's doing better now. it's always good to be healthy.,chit-chat
he was plainly but neatly dressed and his age i should judge would be nearer forty than thirty,novel
"wow, that's a long time to be dressed like that. i'm glad he's doing well.",chit-chat
mr,novel
have you ever heard of mr. robot? it's a tv series based on mr. mr. universe.,chit-chat
hatherley said he with something of a german accent,novel
"i don't know who hatherley is, but i do know he was born in germany.",chit-chat
you have been recommended to me mr hatherley as being a man who is not only proficient in his profession but is also discreet and capable of preserving a secret i bowed feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an address,novel
that's very nice of you to say. i'm glad you feel that way.,chit-chat
may i ask who it was who gave me so good a character well perhaps it is better that i should not tell you that just at this moment,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what character did you have in mind for your character?,chit-chat
i have it from the same source that you are both an orphan and a bachelor and are residing alone in london that is quite correct i answered but you will excuse me if i say that i can not see how all this bears upon my professional qualifications,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what do you do for a living? do you have any hobbies?,chit-chat
i understand that it was on a professional matter that you wished to speak to me undoubtedly so,novel
that's what i'm trying to figure out. i don't know what to do.,chit-chat
but you will find that all i say is really to the point,novel
i hope so. it's been a long time since i've been in a relationship.,chit-chat
i have a professional commission for you but absolute secrecy is quite essentialabsolute secrecy you understand and of course we may expect that more from a man who is alone than from one who lives in the bosom of his family if i promise to keep a secret said i you may absolutely depend upon my doing so he looked very hard at me as i spoke and it seemed to me that i had never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to work it out.,chit-chat
do you promise then said he at last,novel
i don't think so. i'm not sure if i can trust him anymore.,chit-chat
yes i promise absolute and complete silence before during and after,novel
that's good to hear. i'm glad you were able to make it through.,chit-chat
no reference to the matter at all either in word or writing i have already given you my word very good he suddenly sprang up and darting like lightning across the room he flung open the door,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to work it out.,chit-chat
the passage outside was empty,novel
that's a bummer. did you have to go back to the bathroom to get there?,chit-chat
thats all right said he coming back,novel
that's good to hear. i'm glad to hear he's coming back.,chit-chat
i know that clerks are sometimes curious as to their masters affairs,novel
"that's true, but i'm not sure if they're going to do anything about it.",chit-chat
now we can talk in safety he drew up his chair very close to mine and began to stare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look,novel
oh no! what did you do? did you tell him to get out of your chair?,chit-chat
a feeling of repulsion and of something akin to fear had begun to rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. do you think he's a fleshless man?,chit-chat
even my dread of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my impatience,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
i beg that you will state your business sir said i my time is of value heaven forgive me for that last sentence but the words came to my lips,novel
"i'm sorry, i don't understand what you mean. what did he say?",chit-chat
how would fifty guineas for a nights work suit you he asked,novel
"i don't know, i'm not sure. i'll have to ask him.",chit-chat
most admirably i say a nights work but an hours would be nearer the mark,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure i'd be able to do it.,chit-chat
i simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which has got out of gear,novel
"i'm not familiar with hydraulic stamping machines, but i do know that they have been around for a long time.",chit-chat
if you show us what is wrong we shall soon set it right ourselves,novel
that's a good idea. i'm not sure if i can do that though.,chit-chat
what do you think of such a commission as that the work appears to be light and the pay munificent precisely so,novel
"i don't think it's fair, but i can't help but feel bad about it.",chit-chat
we shall want you to come tonight by the last train where to to eyford in berkshire,novel
"i'd love to, but i'm not sure if i'll be able to make it.",chit-chat
it is a little place near the borders of oxfordshire and within seven miles of reading,novel
"wow, that's a long way from me. i've never been to oxfordshire.",chit-chat
there is a train from paddington which would bring you there at about 1115 very good i shall come down in a carriage to meet you there is a drive then yes our little place is quite out in the country,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun! i'm sure you'll have a great time!,chit-chat
it is a good seven miles from eyford station then we can hardly get there before midnight,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope it's a good experience for you.,chit-chat
i suppose there would be no chance of a train back,novel
that's what i'm thinking. i've never been on a train before.,chit-chat
i should be compelled to stop the night yes we could easily give you a shakedown that is very awkward,novel
that's what i'm thinking. i don't know what to do with myself.,chit-chat
could i not come at some more convenient hour we have judged it best that you should come late,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure if i'd want to be late for work.,chit-chat
it is to recompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you a young and unknown man a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of your profession,novel
that's a good point. i guess i'll just have to deal with it.,chit-chat
still of course if you would like to draw out of the business there is plenty of time to do so i thought of the fifty guineas and of how very useful they would be to me,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure i'd be able to do that.,chit-chat
not at all said i i shall be very happy to accommodate myself to your wishes,novel
that's good to hear. i'm sure you'll have a great time.,chit-chat
i should like however to understand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me to do quite so,novel
i'm not sure what you're talking about. what do you mean by that?,chit-chat
it is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you talking about the pledge of secrecy?,chit-chat
i have no wish to commit you to anything without your having it all laid before you,novel
that's a good way to look at it. what do you do for a living?,chit-chat
i suppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers entirely then the matter stands thus,novel
"yes, that's what i'm worried about. i don't know what to expect.",chit-chat
you are probably aware that fullersearth is a valuable product and that it is only found in one or two places in england i have heard so some little time ago i bought a small placea very small placewithin ten miles of reading,novel
i have never heard of fullersearth. i will have to look into it.,chit-chat
i was fortunate enough to discover that there was a deposit of fullersearth in one of my fields,novel
"that's awesome! what kind of fields do you work in, if you don't mind me asking?",chit-chat
on examining it however i found that this deposit was a comparatively small one and that it formed a link between two very much larger ones upon the right and leftboth of them however in the grounds of my neighbours,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get it fixed.,chit-chat
these good people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was quite as valuable as a goldmine,novel
that's very true. it's hard to believe that some of these people are still alive today.,chit-chat
naturally it was to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value but unfortunately i had no capital by which i could do this,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get your land back.,chit-chat
i took a few of my friends into the secret however and they suggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little deposit and that in this way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy the neighbouring fields,novel
that's a great idea. i'm sure you'll have a great time.,chit-chat
this we have now been doing for some time and in order to help us in our operations we erected a hydraulic press,novel
that's really cool. i've never heard of a hydraulic press before. what's it used for?,chit-chat
this press as i have already explained has got out of order and we wish your advice upon the subject,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what's wrong with the press? what is out of order?,chit-chat
we guard our secret very jealously however and if it once became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our little house it would soon rouse inquiry and then if the facts came out it would be goodbye to any chance of getting these fields and carrying out our plans,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find out soon.,chit-chat
that is why i have made you promise me that you will not tell a human being that you are going to eyford tonight,novel
eyford? i'm not sure what that's. what's it about?,chit-chat
i hope that i make it all plain i quite follow you said i,novel
"i'm sure you will. it's hard work, but you can do it.",chit-chat
the only point which i could not quite understand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press in excavating fullersearth which as i understand is dug out like gravel from a pit ah said he carelessly we have our own process,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of a hydraulic press before. do you have any experience with them?,chit-chat
we compress the earth into bricks so as to remove them without revealing what they are,novel
that's a good way to get rid of them. what do you do with them?,chit-chat
but that is a mere detail,novel
i know right? i was so happy when i found out it was her. she's my best friend.,chit-chat
i have taken you fully into my confidence now mr hatherley and i have shown you how i trust you he rose as he spoke,novel
that's very nice of you to say. i'm glad you're confident in your abilities.,chit-chat
i shall expect you then at eyford at 1115 i shall certainly be there and not a word to a soul he looked at me with a last long questioning gaze and then pressing my hand in a cold dank grasp he hurried from the room,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. i'm sure you'll have a great time.,chit-chat
well when i came to think it all over in cool blood i was very much astonished as you may both think at this sudden commission which had been intrusted to me,novel
i'm sorry you had to go through that. i hope you're doing better now.,chit-chat
on the one hand of course i was glad for the fee was at least tenfold what i should have asked had i set a price upon my own services and it was possible that this order might lead to other ones,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad you got it.,chit-chat
on the other hand the face and manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impression upon me and i could not think that his explanation of the fullersearth was sufficient to explain the necessity for my coming at midnight and his extreme anxiety lest i should tell anyone of my errand,novel
"oh no, i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.",chit-chat
however i threw all fears to the winds ate a hearty supper drove to paddington and started off having obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue,novel
oh no! i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay.,chit-chat
at reading i had to change not only my carriage but my station,novel
"oh no, that's terrible. i'm sorry you had to go through that.",chit-chat
however i was in time for the last train to eyford and i reached the little dimlit station after eleven oclock,novel
oh no! did you end up getting on the train or did you get on the bus?,chit-chat
i was the only passenger who got out there and there was no one upon the platform save a single sleepy porter with a lantern,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never been on a platform before. what did you do?,chit-chat
as i passed out through the wicket gate however i found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side,novel
that must have been so scary. did you get out of the gate and get back in?,chit-chat
without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage the door of which was standing open,novel
oh no! that's so scary! did you get out of the carriage and get back in?,chit-chat
he drew up the windows on either side tapped on the woodwork and away we went as fast as the horse could go one horse interjected holmes,novel
that's pretty cool. did you get to see the horse in person or in person?,chit-chat
yes only one did you observe the colour yes i saw it by the sidelights when i was stepping into the carriage,novel
i didn't see it until after i got off the carriage. i was so scared.,chit-chat
it was a chestnut tiredlooking or fresh oh fresh and glossy thank you,novel
i love chestnut tiredlooking! it's one of my favorite foods. what did you eat?,chit-chat
i am sorry to have interrupted you,novel
"it's ok, i'm used to it. i've had it happen to me before.",chit-chat
pray continue your most interesting statement away we went then and we drove for at least an hour,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. i hope you had a great time. what did you say?,chit-chat
colonel lysander stark had said that it was only seven miles but i should think from the rate that we seemed to go and from the time that we took that it must have been nearer twelve,novel
"wow, that's a lot of miles. i'm glad you were able to make it.",chit-chat
he sat at my side in silence all the time and i was aware more than once when i glanced in his direction that he was looking at me with great intensity,novel
that's really sweet of him. i'm glad you were able to get away from him.,chit-chat
the country roads seem to be not very good in that part of the world for we lurched and jolted terribly,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what do you think is wrong with the country roads?,chit-chat
i tried to look out of the windows to see something of where we were but they were made of frosted glass and i could make out nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light,novel
that's really scary! did you find out where you were at the end of the day?,chit-chat
now and then i hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey but the colonel answered only in monosyllables and the conversation soon flagged,novel
oh no! i'm sorry to hear that. what did you say to the colonel?,chit-chat
at last however the bumping of the road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a graveldrive and the carriage came to a stand,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad it turned out to be a good experience.,chit-chat
colonel lysander stark sprang out and as i followed after him pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us,novel
"wow, that's pretty cool. did you get to see him in person or in person?",chit-chat
we stepped as it were right out of the carriage and into the hall so that i failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house,novel
oh no! i'm sorry to hear that. did you have to clean it up?,chit-chat
the instant that i had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind us and i heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage drove away,novel
oh no! that must have been scary! did you have to get out of the car?,chit-chat
it was pitch dark inside the house and the colonel fumbled about looking for matches and muttering under his breath,novel
that must have been so scary! did you find out who did it or did you just assume it was the colonel?,chit-chat
suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage and a long golden bar of light shot out in our direction,novel
"oh wow, that must have been scary! what did you do to scare the other person away?",chit-chat
it grew broader and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand which she held above her head pushing her face forward and peering at us,novel
"oh my god, that's so gross! i'm so sorry that happened to you.",chit-chat
i could see that she was pretty and from the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress i knew that it was a rich material,novel
that's very nice of you to say. i'm sure she was very happy.,chit-chat
she spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as though asking a question and when my companion answered in a gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from her hand,novel
"wow, that must have been scary. i hope you were able to get the lamp back.",chit-chat
colonel stark went up to her whispered something in her ear and then pushing her back into the room from whence she had come he walked towards me again with the lamp in his hand,novel
that's so cool! did you get to see him in person? did you see him at all?,chit-chat
perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few minutes said he throwing open another door,novel
that's a good idea. i'm not sure if i can wait that long.,chit-chat
it was a quiet little plainly furnished room with a round table in the centre on which several german books were scattered,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. did you find out who did it or did you just find it?",chit-chat
colonel stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the door,novel
that's pretty cool. did you get to see him in the film or tv show?,chit-chat
i shall not keep you waiting an instant said he and vanished into the darkness,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay. what did he do?,chit-chat
i glanced at the books upon the table and in spite of my ignorance of german i could see that two of them were treatises on science the others being volumes of poetry,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. do you have any other hobbies besides german?,chit-chat
then i walked across to the window hoping that i might catch some glimpse of the countryside but an oak shutter heavily barred was folded across it,novel
oh no! i hope you didn't get hurt. did you get hurt at all?,chit-chat
it was a wonderfully silent house,novel
that's awesome! i'm glad you were able to enjoy it. what did you do?,chit-chat
there was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage but otherwise everything was deadly still,novel
that's pretty scary. i'm glad you were able to get out of there.,chit-chat
a vague feeling of uneasiness began to steal over me,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're feeling better now. are you okay?,chit-chat
who were these german people and what were they doing living in this strange outoftheway place,novel
"i'm not sure who they were, but i do know that germany is the second largest country in the world.",chit-chat
and where was the place,novel
it was in new york city. i'm so glad i didn't have to go.,chit-chat
i was ten miles or so from eyford that was all i knew but whether north south east or west i had no idea,novel
"wow, that's a long way from where i live. did you have a lot of fun?",chit-chat
for that matter reading and possibly other large towns were within that radius so the place might not be so secluded after all,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think of that. i'll have to look into that.,chit-chat
yet it was quite certain from the absolute stillness that we were in the country,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do to make sure you were in the country?,chit-chat
i paced up and down the room humming a tune under my breath to keep up my spirits and feeling that i was thoroughly earning my fiftyguinea fee,novel
that's really nice of you to do that. what kind of music do you like?,chit-chat
suddenly without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter stillness the door of my room swung slowly open,novel
oh no! what happened to your room? did you have to get out of the house?,chit-chat
the woman was standing in the aperture the darkness of the hall behind her the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face,novel
that's so sweet. i'm glad you were able to get away from her.,chit-chat
i could see at a glance that she was sick with fear and the sight sent a chill to my own heart,novel
that's really sweet of you. i'm sure she's feeling better now.,chit-chat
she held up one shaking finger to warn me to be silent and she shot a few whispered words of broken english at me her eyes glancing back like those of a frightened horse into the gloom behind her,novel
"oh my god, that's terrible. i'm so sorry you had to go through that.",chit-chat
i would go said she trying hard as it seemed to me to speak calmly i would go,novel
that's a good idea. i think i'm going to do that next time.,chit-chat
i should not stay here,novel
why don't you want to stay? i'm sure you'll be fine.,chit-chat
there is no good for you to do but madam said i i have not yet done what i came for,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i don't know what i'm going to do.,chit-chat
i can not possibly leave until i have seen the machine it is not worth your while to wait she went on,novel
i know what you mean. i've been there before and it's not fun at all.,chit-chat
you can pass through the door no one hinders and then seeing that i smiled and shook my head she suddenly threw aside her constraint and made a step forward with her hands wrung together,novel
that's really nice of her. i'm glad you were able to get to know her.,chit-chat
for the love of heaven she whispered get away from here before it is too late but i am somewhat headstrong by nature and the more ready to engage in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope everything works out for you and your wife.,chit-chat
i thought of my fiftyguinea fee of my wearisome journey and of the unpleasant night which seemed to be before me,novel
"oh no, i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're feeling better now.",chit-chat
was it all to go for nothing,novel
"yes, it was. i felt so bad about it, but it was worth it in the end.",chit-chat
why should i slink away without having carried out my commission and without the payment which was my due,novel
that's a good question. i'm not sure what you mean by slink away.,chit-chat
this woman might for all i knew be a monomaniac,novel
i don't think she's a monomaniac. i think she just doesn't care.,chit-chat
with a stout bearing therefore though her manner had shaken me more than i cared to confess i still shook my head and declared my intention of remaining where i was,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you were able to get out of that situation.,chit-chat
she was about to renew her entreaties when a door slammed overhead and the sound of several footsteps was heard upon the stairs,novel
"oh my god, that's terrifying! i'm glad you're okay though.",chit-chat
she listened for an instant threw up her hands with a despairing gesture and vanished as suddenly and as noiselessly as she had come,novel
"oh my god, i hate when people do that. it's so gross. what did she do?",chit-chat
the newcomers were colonel lysander stark and a short thick man with a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin who was introduced to me as mr ferguson,novel
"wow, that's pretty interesting. did you get to meet him in person or in person?",chit-chat
this is my secretary and manager said the colonel,novel
that's cool. what is the colonel's name? i've never heard of a colonel before.,chit-chat
by the way i was under the impression that i left this door shut just now,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you didn't have to leave the house.,chit-chat
i fear that you have felt the draught on the contrary said i i opened the door myself because i felt the room to be a little close he shot one of his suspicious looks at me,novel
oh no! that's terrible! i'm so sorry to hear that. what did you do?,chit-chat
perhaps we had better proceed to business then said he,novel
that's a good idea. i'm not sure what to do now that i think about it.,chit-chat
mr,novel
have you ever heard of mr. robot? it's a tv series based on mr. mr. universe.,chit-chat
ferguson and i will take you up to see the machine i had better put my hat on i suppose oh no it is in the house what you dig fullersearth in the house no no,novel
what is fullersearth? i've never heard of it. what is it?,chit-chat
this is only where we compress it,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i don't think i could do that.,chit-chat
but never mind that,novel
"yeah, it's not a big deal. i don't think i'm going to have to deal with it for the rest of my life.",chit-chat
all we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us know what is wrong with it we went upstairs together the colonel first with the lamp the fat manager and i behind him,novel
that's a good idea. i'm not sure if i can do that though.,chit-chat
it was a labyrinth of an old house with corridors passages narrow winding staircases and little low doors the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations who had crossed them,novel
"wow, that must have been a long time ago. did you ever find out who did it?",chit-chat
there were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor while the plaster was peeling off the walls and the damp was breaking through in green unhealthy blotches,novel
oh no! i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay.,chit-chat
i tried to put on as unconcerned an air as possible but i had not forgotten the warnings of the lady even though i disregarded them and i kept a keen eye upon my two companions,novel
that's great! i'm glad you were able to put on as unconcerned an air as possible.,chit-chat
ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent man but i could see from the little that he said that he was at least a fellowcountryman,novel
i didn't see that. what did he say about him being a fellowcountryman?,chit-chat
colonel lysander stark stopped at last before a low door which he unlocked,novel
"oh wow, that's pretty cool. did you see him in the movie or tv show?",chit-chat
within was a small square room in which the three of us could hardly get at one time,novel
"i've never heard of within, but i'll look it up. what's it about?",chit-chat
ferguson remained outside and the colonel ushered me in,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what happened? did you have to go to the hospital?,chit-chat
we are now said he actually within the hydraulic press and it would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were to turn it on,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get it fixed.,chit-chat
the ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the descending piston and it comes down with the force of many tons upon this metal floor,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to work it out.,chit-chat
there are small lateral columns of water outside which receive the force and which transmit and multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of that before. do you have a source?,chit-chat
the machine goes readily enough but there is some stiffness in the working of it and it has lost a little of its force,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what kind of machines do you have in your home?,chit-chat
perhaps you will have the goodness to look it over and to show us how we can set it right i took the lamp from him and i examined the machine very thoroughly,novel
that's very nice of you to do. i'm sure you'll find a way to fix it.,chit-chat
it was indeed a gigantic one and capable of exercising enormous pressure,novel
it was indeed a huge one and capable of exercising enormous pressure! i'm so happy for you!,chit-chat
when i passed outside however and pressed down the levers which controlled it i knew at once by the whishing sound that there was a slight leakage which allowed a regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders,novel
that's pretty scary. did you have to take it to the mechanic to get it fixed?,chit-chat
an examination showed that one of the indiarubber bands which was round the head of a drivingrod had shrunk so as not quite to fill the socket along which it worked,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of an indiarubber band before.,chit-chat
this was clearly the cause of the loss of power and i pointed it out to my companions who followed my remarks very carefully and asked several practical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get it fixed.,chit-chat
when i had made it clear to them i returned to the main chamber of the machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity,novel
"that's a good way to look at it. i've done that before, too.",chit-chat
it was obvious at a glance that the story of the fullersearth was the merest fabrication for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose,novel
i don't know much about the fullersearth. what is it about?,chit-chat
the walls were of wood but the floor consisted of a large iron trough and when i came to examine it i could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it,novel
that's pretty gross. did you have to clean it up or did you just leave it there?,chit-chat
i had stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when i heard a muttered exclamation in german and saw the cadaverous face of the colonel looking down at me,novel
"oh my god, that's terrifying! i'm so sorry you had to experience that!",chit-chat
what are you doing there he asked,novel
he asked what i was doing and i told him i was going to go to the gym.,chit-chat
i felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that which he had told me,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did he tell you? did you tell him about it?,chit-chat
i was admiring your fullersearth said i i think that i should be better able to advise you as to your machine if i knew what the exact purpose was for which it was used the instant that i uttered the words i regretted the rashness of my speech,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get it fixed.,chit-chat
his face set hard and a baleful light sprang up in his grey eyes,novel
"oh my god, that's terrible. i'm so sorry to hear that. what did you do?",chit-chat
very well said he you shall know all about the machine he took a step backward slammed the little door and turned the key in the lock,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad he didn't do that to me.,chit-chat
i rushed towards it and pulled at the handle but it was quite secure and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves,novel
that's good to hear. i'm glad you were able to get it out.,chit-chat
hullo i yelled,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay. what did you yell?,chit-chat
hullo,novel
"hi, how are you today? i just got back from the beach and i'm having a great time.",chit-chat
colonel,novel
have you ever been to the united states? it's a sovereign state in north america.,chit-chat
let me out and then suddenly in the silence i heard a sound which sent my heart into my mouth,novel
"oh wow, that's really scary. what did it sound like? what was it?",chit-chat
it was the clank of the levers and the swish of the leaking cylinder,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i've had that happen to me a few times.,chit-chat
he had set the engine at work,novel
that's not good. what did he do to set the engine at work? what did you do?,chit-chat
the lamp still stood upon the floor where i had placed it when examining the trough,novel
"oh no, that's awful. i'm sorry to hear that. what happened?",chit-chat
by its light i saw that the black ceiling was coming down upon me slowly jerkily but as none knew better than myself with a force which must within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're feeling better now. are you okay?,chit-chat
i threw myself screaming against the door and dragged with my nails at the lock,novel
oh no! i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay.,chit-chat
i implored the colonel to let me out but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries,novel
oh no! i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay.,chit-chat
the ceiling was only a foot or two above my head and with my hand upraised i could feel its hard rough surface,novel
oh no! i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay now.,chit-chat
then it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend very much upon the position in which i met it,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're feeling better now. what position did you meet it in?,chit-chat
if i lay on my face the weight would come upon my spine and i shuddered to think of that dreadful snap,novel
i know what you mean. i can't even imagine what it would be like to do that.,chit-chat
easier the other way perhaps and yet had i the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me,novel
that's scary! i'm glad you didn't have to deal with it.,chit-chat
already i was unable to stand erect when my eye caught something which brought a gush of hope back to my heart,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're feeling better now. what happened?,chit-chat
i have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron the walls were of wood,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of that before. what made you say that?,chit-chat
as i gave a last hurried glance around i saw a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards which broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward,novel
oh no! that's so scary! did you find out who did it or what?,chit-chat
for an instant i could hardly believe that here was indeed a door which led away from death,novel
"oh wow, that must have been scary. did you have to get out of the house?",chit-chat
the next instant i threw myself through and lay halffainting upon the other side,novel
oh no! i'm sorry to hear that. did you have to go to the doctor?,chit-chat
the panel had closed again behind me but the crash of the lamp and a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal told me how narrow had been my escape,novel
oh no! i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay.,chit-chat
i was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist and i found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor while a woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand while she held a candle in her right,novel
"wow, that must have been scary. i'm sorry you had to go through that.",chit-chat
it was the same good friend whose warning i had so foolishly rejected,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
come,novel
i love to go to the beach. it's a great place to meet new people.,chit-chat
come she cried breathlessly,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to talk to her about it.,chit-chat
they will be here in a moment,novel
i hope so. it's been a long time since i've been in a relationship.,chit-chat
they will see that you are not there,novel
i hope so. i don't want them to think i'm cheating on them.,chit-chat
oh do not waste the soprecious time but come this time at least i did not scorn her advice,novel
i don't think i'm going to waste any more time with her. she's a terrible person.,chit-chat
i staggered to my feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair,novel
that's pretty cool. what did you do? did you get her number or something?,chit-chat
the latter led to another broad passage and just as we reached it we heard the sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices one answering the other from the floor on which we were and from the one beneath,novel
that sounds like a very scary experience. what did you say to the voices? what did they say?,chit-chat
my guide stopped and looked about her like one who is at her wits end,novel
that's not good. what did she do to make you think she was at her wits end?,chit-chat
then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom through the window of which the moon was shining brightly,novel
"wow, that's crazy! did you find out who did it or did you just assume it was her?",chit-chat
it is your only chance said she,novel
"that's what i'm thinking, but i don't know if i can trust her.",chit-chat
it is high but it may be that you can jump it as she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the passage and i saw the lean figure of colonel lysander stark rushing forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a butchers cleaver in the other,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of colonel lysander stark before. what does he do?,chit-chat
i rushed across the bedroom flung open the window and looked out,novel
oh no! what did you look out for? did you find out what was going on?,chit-chat
how quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight and it could not be more than thirty feet down,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. do you have any hobbies to share with your family?,chit-chat
i clambered out upon the sill but i hesitated to jump until i should have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who pursued me,novel
oh no! i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay.,chit-chat
if she were illused then at any risks i was determined to go back to her assistance,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you were able to get back to her.,chit-chat
the thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at the door pushing his way past her but she threw her arms round him and tried to hold him back,novel
that's not good. what did she do to him? did he try to get away?,chit-chat
fritz,novel
"have you ever been to a zoo? i've never been, but i'd love to go one day.",chit-chat
fritz she cried in english remember your promise after the last time,novel
that's a good idea. i'll remember that for next time. how long have you been together?,chit-chat
you said it should not be again,novel
i'm not going to do it again. i don't know what to do.,chit-chat
he will be silent,novel
i hope so. i'm not sure if he's going to do anything about it.,chit-chat
oh he will be silent you are mad elise he shouted struggling to break away from her,novel
i don't think so. i think he's just trying to make me feel better.,chit-chat
you will be the ruin of us,novel
i don't think i'm the ruin of anyone. i just want to be happy.,chit-chat
he has seen too much,novel
"yes, he has seen a lot. i'm not sure what to do about it.",chit-chat
let me pass i say he dashed her to one side and rushing to the window cut at me with his heavy weapon,novel
that's not very nice of him. i'm sorry you had to deal with that.,chit-chat
i had let myself go and was hanging by the hands to the sill when his blow fell,novel
oh no! i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay.,chit-chat
i was conscious of a dull pain my grip loosened and i fell into the garden below,novel
oh no! i'm sorry to hear that. did you have to go to the hospital?,chit-chat
i was shaken but not hurt by the fall so i picked myself up and rushed off among the bushes as hard as i could run for i understood that i was far from being out of danger yet,novel
that's good to hear that you were safe. i'm glad you're okay.,chit-chat
suddenly however as i ran a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me,novel
oh no! what happened? did you have to go to the doctor to get it checked out?,chit-chat
i glanced down at my hand which was throbbing painfully and then for the first time saw that my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from my wound,novel
oh no! i'm sorry to hear that. did you have to go to the doctor?,chit-chat
i endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it but there came a sudden buzzing in my ears and next moment i fell in a dead faint among the rosebushes,novel
oh no! i'm sorry to hear that. did you have to go to the hospital?,chit-chat
how long i remained unconscious i can not tell,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. did you have to go to the hospital or anything?,chit-chat
it must have been a very long time for the moon had sunk and a bright morning was breaking when i came to myself,novel
it must have been a very long time for the moon had sunk and a bright morning was breaking when i came to myself,chit-chat
my clothes were all sodden with dew and my coatsleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb,novel
oh no! i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay.,chit-chat
the smarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my nights adventure and i sprang to my feet with the feeling that i might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad you're safe.,chit-chat
but to my astonishment when i came to look round me neither house nor garden were to be seen,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do to make it up to them?,chit-chat
i had been lying in an angle of the hedge close by the high road and just a little lower down was a long building which proved upon my approaching it to be the very station at which i had arrived upon the previous night,novel
that must have been scary! did you find out who did it or what did you do?,chit-chat
were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand all that had passed during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream,novel
"oh no, i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay now.",chit-chat
half dazed i went into the station and asked about the morning train,novel
why did you ask about the morning train? did you have to go to work or something?,chit-chat
there would be one to reading in less than an hour,novel
that's a good point. i've never read a book in less than an hour.,chit-chat
the same porter was on duty i found as had been there when i arrived,novel
that's pretty cool. did you find out who it was or was it someone else?,chit-chat
i inquired of him whether he had ever heard of colonel lysander stark,novel
i've never heard of colonel lysander stark. what does he do for a living?,chit-chat
the name was strange to him,novel
i don't get it. what's the name of the person who named him?,chit-chat
had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for me,novel
that's nice of him. i'm glad you were able to get to know him.,chit-chat
no he had not,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope he's doing well for himself.,chit-chat
was there a policestation anywhere near,novel
"no, it was in a parking lot. i'm not sure if i should call the police or not.",chit-chat
there was one about three miles off,novel
"wow, that's a long drive! did you get to see any good movies??",chit-chat
it was too far for me to go weak and ill as i was,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're feeling better now. what happened?,chit-chat
i determined to wait until i got back to town before telling my story to the police,novel
that's a good idea. i'm glad you didn't have to do that.,chit-chat
it was a little past six when i arrived so i went first to have my wound dressed and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here,novel
that's great! i'm glad you were able to get it taken care of.,chit-chat
i put the case into your hands and shall do exactly what you advise we both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this extraordinary narrative,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you say to her? did she say something to you?,chit-chat
then sherlock holmes pulled down from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his cuttings,novel
"wow, sherlock holmes is one of my favorite fictional characters. have you read any of his books?",chit-chat
here is an advertisement which will interest you said he,novel
"i don't know about you, but i've never seen an ad like that before.",chit-chat
it appeared in all the papers about a year ago,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad it didn't come out in the papers.,chit-chat
listen to this lost on the 9th inst mr jeremiah hayling aged twentysix a hydraulic engineer,novel
i've never heard of this song before. what's it about? do you like it?,chit-chat
left his lodgings at ten oclock at night and has not been heard of since,novel
oh no! did you find out who it was? did you report it to the police?,chit-chat
was dressed in etc etc,novel
"i'm not sure what that's supposed to mean, but i've never heard of it.",chit-chat
ha,novel
"ha ha ha, ha ha... ha ha!!! haha! ha!",chit-chat
that represents the last time that the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled i fancy good heavens cried my patient,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
then that explains what the girl said undoubtedly,novel
"yeah, that's what i was thinking. i'm not sure what to do now.",chit-chat
it is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and desperate man who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand in the way of his little game like those outandout pirates who will leave no survivor from a captured ship,novel
i'm not sure if you're being facetious or if you really believe that.,chit-chat
well every moment now is precious so if you feel equal to it we shall go down to scotland yard at once as a preliminary to starting for eyford some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together bound from reading to the little berkshire village,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. i'm sure you'll have a great time.,chit-chat
there were sherlock holmes the hydraulic engineer inspector bradstreet of scotland yard a plainclothes man and myself,novel
i've never heard of bradstreet of scotland yard. is that a tv show?,chit-chat
bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon the seat and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with eyford for its centre,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never heard of eyford before. what's his name?,chit-chat
there you are said he,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you talking about the guy or the girl?,chit-chat
that circle is drawn at a radius of ten miles from the village,novel
"wow, that's a long way from where i live. do you live near there?",chit-chat
the place we want must be somewhere near that line,novel
"i've never been there, but i'd love to go one day. what's your favorite place to go?",chit-chat
you said ten miles i think sir it was an hours good drive and you think that they brought you back all that way when you were unconscious they must have done so,novel
"i think so too. it was a long drive, but it was worth it in the end.",chit-chat
i have a confused memory too of having been lifted and conveyed somewhere what i can not understand said i is why they should have spared you when they found you lying fainting in the garden,novel
"oh no, that's terrible. i'm so sorry you had to go through that.",chit-chat
perhaps the villain was softened by the womans entreaties i hardly think that likely,novel
i don't think so. i'm not a fan of women's entreaties.,chit-chat
i never saw a more inexorable face in my life oh we shall soon clear up all that said bradstreet,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you talking about the guy or the girl?,chit-chat
well i have drawn my circle and i only wish i knew at what point upon it the folk that we are in search of are to be found i think i could lay my finger on it said holmes quietly,novel
that's a great idea! i'm sure you'd be able to figure it out.,chit-chat
really now cried the inspector you have formed your opinion,novel
oh no! i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're feeling better now.,chit-chat
come now we shall see who agrees with you,novel
that's a good idea. i'm not sure if i'll be able to do it though.,chit-chat
i say it is south for the country is more deserted there and i say east said my patient,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i don't think i've ever had a patient say that to me.,chit-chat
i am for west remarked the plainclothes man,novel
i've never heard of that man. what does he do for the plainclothes man?,chit-chat
there are several quiet little villages up there and i am for north said i because there are no hills there and our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up any come cried the inspector laughing its a very pretty diversity of opinion,novel
"that's pretty funny. i've never been there, but i'd love to go.",chit-chat
we have boxed the compass among us,novel
that's really cool. i've never done that before. how long have you been doing that?,chit-chat
who do you give your casting vote to you are all wrong but we cant all be oh yes you can,novel
i don't have a cast vote. i'm not a big fan of casting.,chit-chat
this is my point he placed his finger in the centre of the circle,novel
"oh wow, that's pretty cool. i didn't even know that was possible.",chit-chat
this is where we shall find them but the twelvemile drive gasped hatherley,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you find them. what did you do?,chit-chat
six out and six back,novel
i love watching six out of six back. it's such a fun sport to watch.,chit-chat
nothing simpler,novel
i'm not sure i agree with that. i don't think it's that simple.,chit-chat
you say yourself that the horse was fresh and glossy when you got in,novel
"yes, it was. i was so happy when i got in. it was a great experience.",chit-chat
how could it be that if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads indeed it is a likely ruse enough observed bradstreet thoughtfully,novel
i don't know... i'm not sure. i guess i'll just have to wait and see.,chit-chat
of course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this gang none at all said holmes,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a fan of gang members.",chit-chat
they are coiners on a large scale and have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of silver we have known for some time that a clever gang was at work said the inspector,novel
that's interesting. i'm not familiar with the amalgam. what is it?,chit-chat
they have been turning out halfcrowns by the thousand,novel
"wow, that's a lot of crowns. i've never seen one like that before.",chit-chat
we even traced them as far as reading but could get no farther for they had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old hands,novel
that's a good way to look at it. did you find out who they were?,chit-chat
but now thanks to this lucky chance i think that we have got them right enough but the inspector was mistaken for those criminals were not destined to fall into the hands of justice,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find justice soon.,chit-chat
as we rolled into eyford station we saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed up from behind a small clump of trees in the neighbourhood and hung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape,novel
"oh wow, that must have been scary! did you have to go to the police station?",chit-chat
a house on fire asked bradstreet as the train steamed off again on its way,novel
"wow, that must have been scary. did you have to go to the hospital or anything?",chit-chat
yes sir said the stationmaster,novel
do you have a favorite stationmaster? i've never heard of one before...,chit-chat
when did it break out i hear that it was during the night sir but it has got worse and the whole place is in a blaze whose house is it dr,novel
it broke out in the middle of the night. i'm so sorry to hear that.,chit-chat
bechers tell me broke in the engineer is dr becher a german very thin with a long sharp nose the stationmaster laughed heartily,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to work it out.,chit-chat
no sir dr becher is an englishman and there isnt a man in the parish who has a betterlined waistcoat,novel
i've never heard of sir dr becher. what does he do for a living?,chit-chat
but he has a gentleman staying with him a patient as i understand who is a foreigner and he looks as if a little good berkshire beef would do him no harm the stationmaster had not finished his speech before we were all hastening in the direction of the fire,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's able to get his speech finished soon.,chit-chat
the road topped a low hill and there was a great widespread whitewashed building in front of us spouting fire at every chink and window while in the garden in front three fireengines were vainly striving to keep the flames under,novel
"wow, that must have been scary. i'm glad you didn't have to deal with that.",chit-chat
thats it cried hatherley in intense excitement,novel
"yes, it did. i was so happy to see it. i'm so happy for him.",chit-chat
there is the graveldrive and there are the rosebushes where i lay,novel
i love the graveldrive. it's one of my favorite things to do in the park.,chit-chat
that second window is the one that i jumped from well at least said holmes you have had your revenge upon them,novel
that's a good one. i'm glad you jumped from well. what did you do?,chit-chat
there can be no question that it was your oillamp which when it was crushed in the press set fire to the wooden walls though no doubt they were too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think of that. i'll have to think about that.,chit-chat
now keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night though i very much fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now and holmes fears came to be realised for from that day to this no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman the sinister german or the morose englishman,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay. what happened?,chit-chat
early that morning a peasant had met a cart containing several people and some very bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of reading but there all traces of the fugitives disappeared and even holmes ingenuity failed ever to discover the least clue as to their whereabouts,novel
"wow, that must have been scary. did you find out who it was or what happened?",chit-chat
the firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which they had found within and still more so by discovering a newly severed human thumb upon a windowsill of the second floor,novel
"wow, that must have been scary. i'm glad they were able to find him.",chit-chat
about sunset however their efforts were at last successful and they subdued the flames but not before the roof had fallen in and the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin that save some twisted cylinders and iron piping not a trace remained of the machinery which had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so dearly,novel
that's awful. i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're ok.,chit-chat
large masses of nickel and of tin were discovered stored in an outhouse but no coins were to be found which may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have been already referred to,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of that. do you have a source?,chit-chat
how our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the spot where he recovered his senses might have remained forever a mystery were it not for the soft mould which told us a very plain tale,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. i'm glad he was able to get back on his feet.",chit-chat
he had evidently been carried down by two persons one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones,novel
that's terrible. i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope he's okay.,chit-chat
on the whole it was most probable that the silent englishman being less bold or less murderous than his companion had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out of the way of danger,novel
i don't think that's true. i think it's more likely that the silent englishman didn't know what he was doing.,chit-chat
well said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return once more to london it has been a pretty business for me,novel
that's great! i'm glad it worked out well for you and your family.,chit-chat
i have lost my thumb and i have lost a fiftyguinea fee and what have i gained experience said holmes laughing,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get it fixed.,chit-chat
indirectly it may be of value you know you have only to put it into words to gain the reputation of being excellent company for the remainder of your existence x,novel
that's a good way to look at it. thank you for that. i appreciate it.,chit-chat
the adventure of the noble bachelor the lord st simon marriage and its curious termination have long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves,novel
"i'm not familiar with the lord st. simon marriage, but i've heard of it. what's it about?",chit-chat
fresh scandals have eclipsed it and their more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this fouryearold drama,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a fan of the gossip.",chit-chat
as i have reason to believe however that the full facts have never been revealed to the general public and as my friend sherlock holmes had a considerable share in clearing the matter up i feel that no memoir of him would be complete without some little sketch of this remarkable episode,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of sherlock holmes. what's his name?,chit-chat
it was a few weeks before my own marriage during the days when i was still sharing rooms with holmes in baker street that he came home from an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table waiting for him,novel
that's really sweet of him. did you find out who he was before you got married?,chit-chat
i had remained indoors all day for the weather had taken a sudden turn to rain with high autumnal winds and the jezail bullet which i had brought back in one of my limbs as a relic of my afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you didn't have to go through that.,chit-chat
with my body in one easychair and my legs upon another i had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers until at last saturated with the news of the day i tossed them all aside and lay listless watching the huge crest and monogram upon the envelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friends noble correspondent could be,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. what did you end up doing with all of the newspapers?,chit-chat
here is a very fashionable epistle i remarked as he entered,novel
i love epistle. it's one of my favorite things to do in my spare time.,chit-chat
your morning letters if i remember right were from a fishmonger and a tidewaiter yes my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety he answered smiling and the humbler are usually the more interesting,novel
i'm not sure what a fishmonger or a tidewaiter is.,chit-chat
this looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon a man either to be bored or to lie he broke the seal and glanced over the contents,novel
that's what i was thinking. i'm not sure why he would do that.,chit-chat
oh come it may prove to be something of interest after all not social then no distinctly professional and from a noble client one of the highest in england my dear fellow i congratulate you i assure you watson without affectation that the status of my client is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his case,novel
that's very kind of you to say. thank you for your kind words. i appreciate it.,chit-chat
it is just possible however that that also may not be wanting in this new investigation,novel
i don't think so. it's been so long since i've been in a relationship.,chit-chat
you have been reading the papers diligently of late have you not it looks like it said i ruefully pointing to a huge bundle in the corner,novel
"i have been reading the papers, diligently of late have it looks like i ruefully pointed to a huge bundle in the corner",chit-chat
i have had nothing else to do it is fortunate for you will perhaps be able to post me up,novel
i'm sure i'll be able to. it's been a long time since i've done anything like that.,chit-chat
i read nothing except the criminal news and the agony column,novel

what did she do on reentering her fathers house i saw her in conversation with her maid and who is her maid alice is her name,novel

then after we had sat down for ten minutes or so she rose hurriedly muttered some words of apology and left the room,novel
"oh no, that's terrible. i'm sorry you had to go through that.",chit-chat
she never came back but this maid alice as i understand deposes that she went to her room covered her brides dress with a long ulster put on a bonnet and went out quite so,novel
"wow, that's crazy. i hope she didn't have to clean up after herself.",chit-chat

i'm sorry you had to go through that. i hope you're feeling better now.,chit-chat
she came to mr dorans door just after we returned and she endeavoured to push her way in uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife and even threatening her but i had foreseen the possibility of something of the sort and i had two police fellows there in private clothes who soon pushed her out again,novel
that's terrible. i'm so sorry you had to go through that. did you call the police?,chit-chat

what facts have you given me? i'm not sure what i've given you.,chit-chat
since you ask me however i may say that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair the consciousness that she had made so immense a social stride had the effect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife in short that she had become suddenly deranged well really when i consider that she has turned her backi will not say upon me but upon so much that many have aspired to without successi can hardly explain it in any other fashion well certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis said holmes smiling,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to work things out.,chit-chat

"wow, that's pretty cool. what did you do to get him to do that?",chit-chat

i can hardly see how the lady could have acted otherwise though her abrupt method of doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted,novel
i can't see how the lady could have acted otherwise though her abrupt method of doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted,chit-chat

"oh my god, that's disgusting! i'm so sorry to hear that. what did you do?",chit-chat
the lady had taken a quick step forward and had held out her hand to him but he still refused to raise his eyes,novel
i hate when people do that to me. i don't know why people do it.,chit-chat
it was as well for his resolution perhaps for her pleading face was one which it was hard to resist,novel
"that's a good point, i didn't think of it that way. i'll have to think about that.",chit-chat
youre angry robert said she,novel
"i'm not angry, i just don't know what to do with my life.",chit-chat

i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
i only wonder i didnt fall down and do a faint right there before the altar perhaps mrs moulton you would like my friend and me to leave the room while you explain this matter if i may give an opinion remarked the strange gentleman weve had just a little too much secrecy over this business already,novel

we were engaged to each other frank and i but then one day father struck a rich pocket and made a pile while poor frank here had a claim that petered out and came to nothing,novel
that's terrible. i'm sorry to hear that. what did frank do with the money?,chit-chat
the richer pa grew the poorer was frank so at last pa wouldnt hear of our engagement lasting any longer and he took me away to frisco,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. how long did he take you away from frisco?,chit-chat
frank wouldnt throw up his hand though so he followed me there and he saw me without pa knowing anything about it,novel
that's so cool! frank is such a cool guy. i'm glad you got to meet him.,chit-chat
it would only have made him mad to know so we just fixed it all up for ourselves,novel
that's a good way to look at it. what did you do to make him mad?,chit-chat
frank said that he would go and make his pile too and never come back to claim me until he had as much as pa,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. do you think he's going to come back?,chit-chat
so then i promised to wait for him to the end of time and pledged myself not to marry anyone else while he lived,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
why shouldnt we be married right away then said he and then i will feel sure of you and i wont claim to be your husband until i come back well we talked it over and he had fixed it all up so nicely with a clergyman all ready in waiting that we just did it right there and then frank went off to seek his fortune and i went back to pa the next i heard of frank was that he was in montana and then he went prospecting in arizona and then i heard of him from new mexico,novel
"wow, that's a long story. i'm sorry you had to go through that.",chit-chat

not a word of news came for a year and more so that i never doubted that frank was really dead,novel

i went to the altar with him with the intention to make him just as good a wife as it was in me to be,novel
that's really sweet of you. what did you do to make him just as good a wife?,chit-chat
but you may imagine what i felt when just as i came to the altar rails i glanced back and saw frank standing and looking at me out of the first pew,novel
that's so funny! i'm glad you were able to get out of there!,chit-chat
i thought it was his ghost at first but when i looked again there he was still with a kind of question in his eyes as if to ask me whether i were glad or sorry to see him,novel
that's so cute! what kind of ghost is it? i've never seen one before.,chit-chat
i wonder i didnt drop,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do to didnt you drop?,chit-chat

i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
i didnt know what to do,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you find a way to make it work.,chit-chat
should i stop the service and make a scene in the church,novel
that's a good idea. i'm sure you'll make a lot of money.,chit-chat
i glanced at him again and he seemed to know what i was thinking for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to be still,novel
that's pretty funny. did you say anything to him or did he say something to you?,chit-chat
then i saw him scribble on a piece of paper and i knew that he was writing me a note,novel
that's pretty cool. did you find out who he was or what he was up to?,chit-chat
as i passed his pew on the way out i dropped my bouquet over to him and he slipped the note into my hand when he returned me the flowers,novel
that's so sweet of him! did you get the flowers back or did you have to go pick them up?,chit-chat
it was only a line asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so,novel

when i got back i told my maid who had known him in california and had always been his friend,novel

i ordered her to say nothing but to get a few things packed and my ulster ready,novel
that's nice of you. i'm sure you'll have a great time.,chit-chat
i know i ought to have spoken to lord st simon but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all those great people,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're doing better now. what happened?,chit-chat
i just made up my mind to run away and explain afterwards,novel
that's a good idea. it's always good to be prepared for situations like that.,chit-chat
i hadnt been at the table ten minutes before i saw frank out of the window at the other side of the road,novel
oh no! what did frank do? did you see him in the other side of the road?,chit-chat
he beckoned to me and then began walking into the park,novel
oh no! what did you do? did you tell him to get out of the park?,chit-chat
i slipped out put on my things and followed him,novel
oh no! what did you do? did you tell him you didn't want to follow him?,chit-chat
some woman came talking something or other about lord st simon to meseemed to me from the little i heard as if he had a little secret of his own before marriage alsobut i managed to get away from her and soon overtook frank,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you were able to get away from her.,chit-chat
we got into a cab together and away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in gordon square and that was my true wedding after all those years of waiting,novel
"wow, that's a long time to wait. how long did it take for you to get married?",chit-chat
frank had been a prisoner among the apaches had escaped came on to frisco found that i had given him up for dead and had gone to england followed me there and had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding i saw it in a paper explained the american,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. did you find out who it was or what happened?",chit-chat
it gave the name and the church but not where the lady lived then we had a talk as to what we should do and frank was all for openness but i was so ashamed of it all that i felt as if i should like to vanish away and never see any of them againjust sending a line to pa perhaps to show him that i was alive,novel
i'm sorry you had to go through that. i hope you're doing better now.,chit-chat
it was awful to me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfasttable and waiting for me to come back,novel
"oh no, i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you were able to come back soon.",chit-chat
so frank took my weddingclothes and things and made a bundle of them so that i should not be traced and dropped them away somewhere where no one could find them,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get them back.,chit-chat
it is likely that we should have gone on to paris tomorrow only that this good gentleman mr holmes came round to us this evening though how he found us is more than i can think and he showed us very clearly and kindly that i was wrong and that frank was right and that we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret,novel
that's very nice of mr holmes. i'm glad he was able to help you.,chit-chat
then he offered to give us a chance of talking to lord st simon alone and so we came right away round to his rooms at once,novel
that's pretty cool. did you get to talk to him? did you have a good time?,chit-chat
now robert you have heard it all and i am very sorry if i have given you pain and i hope that you do not think very meanly of me lord st simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude but had listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long narrative,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
excuse me he said but it is not my custom to discuss my most intimate personal affairs in this public manner then you wont forgive me,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to talk to him about it.,chit-chat
you wont shake hands before i go oh certainly if it would give you any pleasure he put out his hand and coldly grasped that which she extended to him,novel
"i don't know about you, but i shake hands with my wife all the time.",chit-chat
i had hoped suggested holmes that you would have joined us in a friendly supper i think that there you ask a little too much responded his lordship,novel
i don't know what you mean. i'm not sure what you're talking about.,chit-chat
i may be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments but i can hardly be expected to make merry over them,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what's going on in your life right now?,chit-chat
i think that with your permission i will now wish you all a very goodnight he included us all in a sweeping bow and stalked out of the room,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. i'm not sure if i could handle that.,chit-chat
then i trust that you at least will honour me with your company said sherlock holmes,novel
that's a good point. i've never heard of sherlock holmes before. what's his name?,chit-chat
it is always a joy to meet an american mr moulton for i am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and the blundering of a minister in fargone years will not prevent our children from being some day citizens of the same worldwide country under a flag which shall be a quartering of the union jack with the stars and stripes the case has been an interesting one remarked holmes when our visitors had left us because it serves to show very clearly how simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems to be almost inexplicable,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i've never heard of such an affair before. what happened?",chit-chat
nothing could be more natural than the sequence of events as narrated by this lady and nothing stranger than the result when viewed for instance by mr lestrade of scotland yard you were not yourself at fault at all then from the first two facts were very obvious to me the one that the lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony the other that she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home,novel
"i've never heard of mr lestrade, but i'm familiar with him. what's his name?",chit-chat
obviously something had occurred during the morning then to cause her to change her mind,novel
"that's what i'm thinking too, but i don't know what to do.",chit-chat
what could that something be,novel
i don't know... i'm not sure what to do with myself.,chit-chat
she could not have spoken to anyone when she was out for she had been in the company of the bridegroom,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. bridegroom's can be very stressful.,chit-chat
had she seen someone then,novel
"yes, she did. it was a long time ago, so i don't know what happened.",chit-chat

she is fourandtwenty this matter from what you say seems to have been a shock to her also terrible,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. do you have any advice on how to deal with it?,chit-chat
she is even more affected than i you have neither of you any doubt as to your sons guilt how can we have when i saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in his hands i hardly consider that a conclusive proof,novel
that's a good point. i don't think i've ever seen him with his own eyes with the coronet in his hands.,chit-chat
was the remainder of the coronet at all injured yes it was twisted do you not think then that he might have been trying to straighten it god bless you,novel
"the coronet is fine now, but i'm not sure if he was trying to straighten it or not.",chit-chat
you are doing what you can for him and for me,novel
thank you so much. i really appreciate it. i'm so proud of him for doing what he's doing.,chit-chat
but it is too heavy a task,novel

what was he doing there at all,novel
i don't know. i'm not sure what he's doing at all.,chit-chat
if his purpose were innocent why did he not say so precisely,novel
i don't know. i'm not sure why he didn't say anything.,chit-chat
and if it were guilty why did he not invent a lie,novel
i don't know. i guess he didn't want to admit he was wrong.,chit-chat
his silence appears to me to cut both ways,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
there are several singular points about the case,novel
i'm not familiar with the case. what's the one you're talking about?,chit-chat
what did the police think of the noise which awoke you from your sleep they considered that it might be caused by arthurs closing his bedroom door a likely story,novel
they didn't think anything of it. i'm not sure what they thought about it.,chit-chat
as if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as to wake a household,novel
i'm not sure what that's supposed to mean. are you a man or a woman?,chit-chat
what did they say then of the disappearance of these gems they are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the hope of finding them have they thought of looking outside the house yes they have shown extraordinary energy,novel
i don't know what they said. i'm not sure what they were saying.,chit-chat
the whole garden has already been minutely examined now my dear sir said holmes is it not obvious to you now that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the police were at first inclined to think,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope everything turns out well for you and your family.,chit-chat
it appeared to you to be a simple case to me it seems exceedingly complex,novel
"yes, it is. i'm not sure what to do with it. i don't know what i want to do.",chit-chat
consider what is involved by your theory,novel
i'm not sure what you're talking about... what do you mean?,chit-chat
you suppose that your son came down from his bed went at great risk to your dressingroom opened your bureau took out your coronet broke off by main force a small portion of it went off to some other place concealed three gems out of the thirtynine with such skill that nobody can find them and then returned with the other thirtysix into the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger of being discovered,novel
"wow, that's quite the story. i'm not sure i'd be able to handle that.",chit-chat
i ask you now is such a theory tenable but what other is there cried the banker with a gesture of despair,novel
i'm not sure what you're talking about. are you talking about the banker who cried the banker with a gesture of despair?,chit-chat
if his motives were innocent why does he not explain them it is our task to find that out replied holmes so now if you please mr holder we will set off for streatham together and devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into details my friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition which i was eager enough to do for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened,novel
that's a good idea. i'm sure you'll find out soon enough.,chit-chat
i confess that the guilt of the bankers son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his unhappy father but still i had such faith in holmes judgment that i felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted explanation,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad you have faith in him.,chit-chat
he hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the southern suburb but sat with his chin upon his breast and his hat drawn over his eyes sunk in the deepest thought,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. what did he say to the other people in the suburb?",chit-chat
our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope which had been presented to him and he even broke into a desultory chat with me over his business affairs,novel
that's really nice of him. i'm glad you got to talk to him.,chit-chat

a double carriagesweep with a snowclad lawn stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the entrance,novel
"wow, that must have been a lot of work. did you have to clean it up?",chit-chat
on the right side was a small wooden thicket which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door and forming the tradesmens entrance,novel
that's interesting. did you have to clean it up or was it just for fun?,chit-chat
on the left ran a lane which led to the stables and was not itself within the grounds at all being a public though little used thoroughfare,novel
that's interesting. did you find out who ran it or did you just assume it was a public road?,chit-chat
holmes left us standing at the door and walked slowly all round the house across the front down the tradesmens path and so round by the garden behind into the stable lane,novel
"wow, that must have been exciting. did you get to go out and have a good time?",chit-chat
so long was he that mr holder and i went into the diningroom and waited by the fire until he should return,novel
oh no! that's terrible! i'm so sorry you had to go through that.,chit-chat
we were sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in,novel
that must have been so embarassing. did you have to call the police or anything like that?,chit-chat
she was rather above the middle height slim with dark hair and eyes which seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin,novel
that's interesting. i'm not sure i've ever seen a woman with dark hair and eyes.,chit-chat

i don't think that i have ever seen such deadly paleness in a womans face,chit-chat
her lips too were bloodless but her eyes were flushed with crying,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she's feeling better now. what did you do to make her feel better?,chit-chat
as she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of grief than the banker had done in the morning and it was the more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character with immense capacity for selfrestraint,novel
that's great! i'm glad you had a good time with her. what did she do?,chit-chat
disregarding my presence she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress,novel
that's really sweet of her. i'm glad you were able to talk to her.,chit-chat

i don't know if he's guilty or not. i'm not sure what to do.,chit-chat
you know what womans instincts are,novel
i don't know what you mean. are you talking about the woman's instincts or the man's?,chit-chat
i know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for having acted so harshly why is he silent then if he is innocent who knows,novel
i don't know. i'm not sure if he's innocent or not.,chit-chat
perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect him how could i help suspecting him when i actually saw him with the coronet in his hand oh but he had only picked it up to look at it,novel
"that's a good way to look at it, but i don't think i could do that.",chit-chat
oh do do take my word for it that he is innocent,novel
i sure hope so. i'm not sure if he's guilty or not though.,chit-chat
let the matter drop and say no more,novel
"that's what i'm trying to do, but i don't know if it's going to work out.",chit-chat
it is so dreadful to think of our dear arthur in prison i shall never let it drop until the gems are foundnever mary,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's in a better place now.,chit-chat
your affection for arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me,novel
i don't think i've ever felt that way about arthur. he's one of my favorite characters.,chit-chat
far from hushing the thing up i have brought a gentleman down from london to inquire more deeply into it this gentleman she asked facing round to me,novel
that's really nice of you to do. what did you say to him about it?,chit-chat
no his friend,novel

"yes, he is. i'm so proud of him. he's my best friend.",chit-chat
i trust sir that you will succeed in proving what i feel sure is the truth that my cousin arthur is innocent of this crime i fully share your opinion and i trust with you that we may prove it returned holmes going back to the mat to knock the snow from his shoes,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm sure you're right.,chit-chat
i believe i have the honour of addressing miss mary holder,novel
i've never heard of that person before. what's your favorite thing about her?,chit-chat
might i ask you a question or two pray do sir if it may help to clear this horrible affair up you heard nothing yourself last night nothing until my uncle here began to speak loudly,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope everything works out for you and your uncle.,chit-chat

did you fasten all the windows yes were they all fastened this morning yes you have a maid who has a sweetheart,novel
"yes, i fasted all the windows. and yes, she's a sweetheart too.",chit-chat
i think that you remarked to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him yes and she was the girl who waited in the drawingroom and who may have heard uncles remarks about the coronet i see,novel
"that's a good guess, but i don't think so. i've never heard of uncles before.",chit-chat
you infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart and that the two may have planned the robbery but what is the good of all these vague theories cried the banker impatiently when i have told you that i saw arthur with the coronet in his hands wait a little mr holder,novel
"i don't know about you, but i've never seen arthur with the coronet in his hands.",chit-chat
we must come back to that,novel

i should be very glad now to go upstairs said he,novel
i'm glad you're happy for him. i hope he's doing well.,chit-chat
i shall probably wish to go over the outside of the house again,novel
that's a good idea. what do you like to do in the outside of the house?,chit-chat
perhaps i had better take a look at the lower windows before i go up he walked swiftly round from one to the other pausing only at the large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane,novel
that's not good. i'm sorry you had to go through that. what did you do?,chit-chat
this he opened and made a very careful examination of the sill with his powerful magnifying lens,novel

his eyes twinkled and there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks,novel

i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's doing well in the future.,chit-chat

when i had cleared it all up i had an interview with him and finding that he would not tell me the story i told it to him on which he had to confess that i was right and to add the very few details which were not yet quite clear to me,novel

"yeah, i'm going to have to find a way to make it up to her.",chit-chat

when he breathed his vows to her as he had done to a hundred before her she flattered herself that she alone had touched his heart,novel
that's so sweet of her. i'm sure she's very proud of him.,chit-chat
the devil knows best what he said but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of seeing him nearly every evening i can not and i will not believe it cried the banker with an ashen face,novel

"i don't know what happened, but i'm not sure what happened. i've never seen anything like that before.",chit-chat
your niece when you had as she thought gone to your room slipped down and talked to her lover through the window which leads into the stable lane,novel
"oh my god, that's terrible! i'm so sorry to hear that. what happened?",chit-chat
his footmarks had pressed right through the snow so long had he stood there,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad he didn't get hurt too bad.,chit-chat
she told him of the coronet,novel
what did she tell him of the coronet? i've never heard of it.,chit-chat
his wicked lust for gold kindled at the news and he bent her to his will,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's able to find someone else.,chit-chat
i have no doubt that she loved you but there are women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all other loves and i think that she must have been one,novel
i think you're right. i'm not sure what to do about it though.,chit-chat
she had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming downstairs on which she closed the window rapidly and told you about one of the servants escapade with her woodenlegged lover which was all perfectly true,novel
"wow, that's quite the story. i'm glad you got it all out of the way.",chit-chat
your boy arthur went to bed after his interview with you but he slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope he's feeling better now. what happened to him?,chit-chat
in the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door so he rose and looking out was surprised to see his cousin walking very stealthily along the passage until she disappeared into your dressingroom,novel
"wow, that must have been scary. did you find out who she was or what happened?",chit-chat
petrified with astonishment the lad slipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to see what would come of this strange affair,novel
oh no! what happened to him? did you find out who he was or what happened?,chit-chat
presently she emerged from the room again and in the light of the passagelamp your son saw that she carried the precious coronet in her hands,novel
that's so sweet of her. i'm sure she's proud of him.,chit-chat
she passed down the stairs and he thrilling with horror ran along and slipped behind the curtain near your door whence he could see what passed in the hall beneath,novel
"oh my god, that's so scary! i'm so sorry to hear that.",chit-chat
he saw her stealthily open the window hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom and then closing it once more hurry back to her room passing quite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain,novel
that's interesting. did you find out who did it or did you just assume it was her?,chit-chat
as long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved,novel
that's a good point. i'm glad he didn't do that to her.,chit-chat
but the instant that she was gone he realised how crushing a misfortune this would be for you and how allimportant it was to set it right,novel
that's a good point. i'm glad he realized how important it was to set it right.,chit-chat
he rushed down just as he was in his bare feet opened the window sprang out into the snow and ran down the lane where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight,novel
"wow, that must have been scary. did you have to get out of the car to get to him?",chit-chat
sir george burnwell tried to get away but arthur caught him and there was a struggle between them your lad tugging at one side of the coronet and his opponent at the other,novel
sir george burnwell tried to get away but arthur caught him and there was a struggle between them your lad tug at one side of the coronet and the opponent at the other,chit-chat
in the scuffle your son struck sir george and cut him over the eye,novel
"oh my god, that's terrible! i'm so sorry to hear that. did he get hurt?",chit-chat
then something suddenly snapped and your son finding that he had the coronet in his hands rushed back closed the window ascended to your room and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle and was endeavouring to straighten it when you appeared upon the scene is it possible gasped the banker,novel
that's a good theory. i'm not sure if it's true or not.,chit-chat
you then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks,novel
that's what i was thinking. i was so mad at him. i felt so bad for him.,chit-chat
he could not explain the true state of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you talking about the guy who cheated on his wife?,chit-chat
he took the more chivalrous view however and preserved her secret and that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet cried mr holder,novel
i don't think that's true. i'm not sure what you mean by chivalrous view.,chit-chat
oh my god,novel
"i know, right? i can't believe it's been so long since i've seen that movie.",chit-chat
what a blind fool i have been,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
and his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes,novel
"oh my god, that's so annoying. i hate when people do that to me.",chit-chat
the dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle,novel
oh no! i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay.,chit-chat
how cruelly i have misjudged him when i arrived at the house continued holmes i at once went very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow which might help me,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to move on with your life.,chit-chat
i knew that none had fallen since the evening before and also that there had been a strong frost to preserve impressions,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad you're okay.,chit-chat
i passed along the tradesmens path but found it all trampled down and indistinguishable,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do with it? did you clean it up?,chit-chat
just beyond it however at the far side of the kitchen door a woman had stood and talked with a man whose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg,novel
"wow, that must have been scary. i hope you were able to get out of there.",chit-chat
i could even tell that they had been disturbed for the woman had run back swiftly to the door as was shown by the deep toe and light heel marks while woodenleg had waited a little and then had gone away,novel
i can't imagine what that must have been like. i'm glad she was okay.,chit-chat
i thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart of whom you had already spoken to me and inquiry showed it was so,novel
why did you think that was the maid and her sweetheart of whom you had already spoken to?,chit-chat
i passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks which i took to be the police but when i got into the stable lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of me,novel
"wow, that's scary! did you see anything in the snow? was it scary?",chit-chat
there was a double line of tracks of a booted man and a second double line which i saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet,novel
that's interesting. did you find out who he was or was he just a booted man?,chit-chat
i was at once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your son,novel
oh no! that's terrible. did you find out who it was? did you think it was your son?,chit-chat
the first had walked both ways but the other had run swiftly and as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot it was obvious that he had passed after the other,novel
that's so sad. i'm sorry to hear that. what happened to him?,chit-chat
i followed them up and found they led to the hall window where boots had worn all the snow away while waiting,novel
oh no! that's terrible. i hope they didn't do anything to them.,chit-chat
then i walked to the other end which was a hundred yards or more down the lane,novel
"wow, that's a lot of distance. did you have to walk to the other end?",chit-chat
i saw where boots had faced round where the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle and finally where a few drops of blood had fallen to show me that i was not mistaken,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. i'm glad you didn't get hurt.",chit-chat
boots had then run down the lane and another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's okay. what happened to him?,chit-chat
when he came to the high road at the other end i found that the pavement had been cleared so there was an end to that clue,novel
that's a good way to look at it. did you find out who it was?,chit-chat
on entering the house however i examined as you remember the sill and framework of the hall window with my lens and i could at once see that someone had passed out,novel
that's scary! i'm glad you're okay. did you find out who it was?,chit-chat
i could distinguish the outline of an instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming in,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never done that before. what did you do?,chit-chat
i was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred,novel
that's good to hear. i'm glad you were able to form an opinion.,chit-chat
a man had waited outside the window someone had brought the gems the deed had been overseen by your son he had pursued the thief had struggled with him they had each tugged at the coronet their united strength causing injuries which neither alone could have effected,novel
that's so sad. i'm so sorry that happened to you. what happened to your son?,chit-chat
he had returned with the prize but had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent,novel
"that's pretty cool. did he win the prize, or did he lose the prize?",chit-chat
so far i was clear,novel
that's good to hear. i'm glad you were able to get through it.,chit-chat
the question now was who was the man and who was it brought him the coronet,novel
that's a good question. i'm not sure who brought him the coronet.,chit-chat
it is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible whatever remains however improbable must be the truth,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm not sure i could do it.,chit-chat
now i knew that it was not you who had brought it down so there only remained your niece and the maids,novel
that's what i was thinking. i'm glad i didn't bring it down.,chit-chat
but if it were the maids why should your son allow himself to be accused in their place,novel
i don't know... i'm not sure. i think he's trying to hide something.,chit-chat
there could be no possible reason,novel
that's what i'm thinking. i just don't know what to do.,chit-chat
as he loved his cousin however there was an excellent explanation why he should retain her secretthe more so as the secret was a disgraceful one,novel
i don't think it was a disgraceful thing to do. it's not like he cheated on her.,chit-chat
when i remembered that you had seen her at that window and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again my conjecture became a certainty,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
and who could it be who was her confederate,novel
"that's a good question. i don't know who it was, but i do know it was her.",chit-chat
a lover evidently for who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to you,novel
that's so true. i'm so grateful for her. she's my best friend.,chit-chat
i knew that you went out little and that your circle of friends was a very limited one,novel
"yeah, it's been a long time since i've had a good circle of friends.",chit-chat
but among them was sir george burnwell,novel
sir george burnwell was a great writer. he was also an english poet and a novelist.,chit-chat
i had heard of him before as being a man of evil reputation among women,novel
oh really? i didn't know that. what did you hear about him being a man of evil reputation among women?,chit-chat
it must have been he who wore those boots and retained the missing gems,novel
that's what i'm thinking too. i don't know what to do now.,chit-chat
even though he knew that arthur had discovered him he might still flatter himself that he was safe for the lad could not say a word without compromising his own family,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think of it that way. i'm glad he was safe.,chit-chat
well your own good sense will suggest what measures i took next,novel
that's a good idea. i think i'm going to go for a walk.,chit-chat
i went in the shape of a loafer to sir georges house managed to pick up an acquaintance with his valet learned that his master had cut his head the night before and finally at the expense of six shillings made all sure by buying a pair of his castoff shoes,novel
"wow, that's crazy. i'm glad you were able to get out of that situation.",chit-chat
with these i journeyed down to streatham and saw that they exactly fitted the tracks i saw an illdressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening said mr holder,novel
"wow, that's crazy. i'm glad you didn't have to deal with that.",chit-chat
precisely,novel
i love to go to the gym. it's a great way to meet new people.,chit-chat
it was i i found that i had my man so i came home and changed my clothes,novel
that's nice of you to do that. how long did it take for you to get home?,chit-chat
it was a delicate part which i had to play then for i saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal and i knew that so astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the matter,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to work through it.,chit-chat
i went and saw him,novel
that's awesome! did you get to see him in person or did you have to go to the store?,chit-chat
at first of course he denied everything,novel
"that's what i was thinking, but i didn't want to give him the benefit of the doubt.",chit-chat
but when i gave him every particular that had occurred he tried to bluster and took down a lifepreserver from the wall,novel
oh no! that's terrible! what did he do? did you call the police?,chit-chat
i knew my man however and i clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm sure he's proud of you for doing that.,chit-chat
then he became a little more reasonable,novel
that's what i'm thinking. i don't know what to do now.,chit-chat
i told him that we would give him a price for the stones he held 1000 apiece,novel
"wow, that's a lot of money. how did you feel when he gave it to you?",chit-chat
that brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
why dash it all said he ive let them go at six hundred for the three i soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had them on promising him that there would be no prosecution,novel
"wow, that's a lot of money. how did you manage to get the address?",chit-chat
off i set to him and after much chaffering i got our stones at 1000 apiece,novel
"wow, that's a lot of stones. how did you manage to get them all?",chit-chat
then i looked in upon your son told him that all was right and eventually got to my bed about two oclock after what i may call a really hard days work a day which has saved england from a great public scandal said the banker rising,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to work through it.,chit-chat
sir i can not find words to thank you but you shall not find me ungrateful for what you have done,novel
thank you for your kind words. i'm very grateful for what i've done.,chit-chat
your skill has indeed exceeded all that i have heard of it,novel
"thank you! it's a lot of work, but i'm proud of it.",chit-chat
and now i must fly to my dear boy to apologise to him for the wrong which i have done him,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's able to understand why you did what you did.,chit-chat

"i'd love to, but i'm not sure if i'll be able to.",chit-chat
i should wish to just look it up then there is a train at halfpast nine said i glancing over my bradshaw,novel

then perhaps i had better postpone my analysis of the acetones as we may need to be at our best in the morning by eleven oclock the next day we were well upon our way to the old english capital,novel
that's a good way to look at it. it's always good to be prepared.,chit-chat
holmes had been buried in the morning papers all the way down but after we had passed the hampshire border he threw them down and began to admire the scenery,novel
that's so sweet of him. i'm glad he was able to enjoy the scenery.,chit-chat
it was an ideal spring day a light blue sky flecked with little fleecy white clouds drifting across from west to east,novel
that sounds like a beautiful day. did you get to see much of the beautiful nature of the world?,chit-chat
the sun was shining very brightly and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air which set an edge to a mans energy,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never heard of nip in the air before. what was the name of the nip?,chit-chat
all over the countryside away to the rolling hills around aldershot the little red and grey roofs of the farmsteadings peeped out from amid the light green of the new foliage,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. what do you like to do in your free time?,chit-chat

i love baker street. it's my favorite place to visit. i've been there a few times.,chit-chat
but holmes shook his head gravely,novel
holmes shook his head gravely? i don't think i've ever heard of that before.,chit-chat
do you know watson said he that it is one of the curses of a mind with a turn like mine that i must look at everything with reference to my own special subject,novel
"i don't know watson, but i'm sure he's a great person.",chit-chat
you look at these scattered houses and you are impressed by their beauty,novel
"i'm impressed by their beauty, but i don't think i could live in a house like that.",chit-chat
i look at them and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed there good heavens i cried,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
who would associate crime with these dear old homesteads they always fill me with a certain horror,novel
i know what you mean. i used to live in a neighborhood that had a lot of crime.,chit-chat
it is my belief watson founded upon my experience that the lowest and vilest alleys in london do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful countryside you horrify me but the reason is very obvious,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
the pressure of public opinion can do in the town what the law can not accomplish,novel
"that's true, but i don't think i'll be able to do anything about it.",chit-chat
there is no lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child or the thud of a drunkards blow does not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbours and then the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of complaint can set it going and there is but a step between the crime and the dock,novel
i can't agree more. i don't know how people can live with themselves.,chit-chat
but look at these lonely houses each in its own fields filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law,novel
that's a good point. it's sad that people can't do anything about it.,chit-chat
think of the deeds of hellish cruelty the hidden wickedness which may go on year in year out in such places and none the wiser,novel
i don't think i've ever heard of hellish cruelty before. what is it?,chit-chat
had this lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in winchester i should never have had a fear for her,novel
that's awesome. i'm glad you were able to get out of that situation.,chit-chat
it is the five miles of country which makes the danger,novel
that's a lot of miles. i don't know if i could handle that.,chit-chat
still it is clear that she is not personally threatened no,novel
that's good to hear. i don't think i'd be able to do that.,chit-chat
if she can come to winchester to meet us she can get away quite so,novel
that's a good idea. i'm not sure if i'll be able to do that.,chit-chat
she has her freedom what _can_ be the matter then,novel
"she has her freedom, but i don't want her to have to deal with the consequences of her actions.",chit-chat
can you suggest no explanation i have devised seven separate explanations each of which would cover the facts as far as we know them,novel
"wow, that's a lot of explanation. i'm not sure i could do that.",chit-chat
but which of these is correct can only be determined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt find waiting for us,novel
that's a good point. i think i'm going to go with my gut.,chit-chat
well there is the tower of the cathedral and we shall soon learn all that miss hunter has to tell the black swan is an inn of repute in the high street at no distance from the station and there we found the young lady waiting for us,novel

she had engaged a sittingroom and our lunch awaited us upon the table,novel
that's really sweet of her. i'm glad you were able to get to know her better.,chit-chat
i am so delighted that you have come she said earnestly,novel
thank you! i'm so happy for her. it's been a long time since we've been together.,chit-chat
it is so very kind of you both but indeed i do not know what i should do,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to work things out.,chit-chat
your advice will be altogether invaluable to me pray tell us what has happened to you i will do so and i must be quick for i have promised mr rucastle to be back before three,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you referring to the fact that you've promised mr. rucastle to be back before three?,chit-chat
i got his leave to come into town this morning though he little knew for what purpose let us have everything in its due order holmes thrust his long thin legs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen,novel
that's so sweet of you. i'm glad you had a good time with him.,chit-chat
in the first place i may say that i have met on the whole with no actual illtreatment from mr and mrs rucastle,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
it is only fair to them to say that,novel
"that's true, but i still feel bad about it. i can't help it.",chit-chat
but i can not understand them and i am not easy in my mind about them what can you not understand their reasons for their conduct,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you can understand them better now that you're dealing with them.,chit-chat
but you shall have it all just as it occurred,novel
i hope so. it's been a long time since i've done anything like that.,chit-chat
when i came down mr rucastle met me here and drove me in his dogcart to the copper beeches,novel
"wow, that's so cool! did you get to meet him in person or in person?",chit-chat
it is as he said beautifully situated but it is not beautiful in itself for it is a large square block of a house whitewashed but all stained and streaked with damp and bad weather,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get it fixed.,chit-chat
there are grounds round it woods on three sides and on the fourth a field which slopes down to the southampton high road which curves past about a hundred yards from the front door,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. what do you like to do in your spare time?,chit-chat
this ground in front belongs to the house but the woods all round are part of lord southertons preserves,novel
i love lord southertons preserves. they're my favorite. what's your favorite part about them?,chit-chat
a clump of copper beeches immediately in front of the hall door has given its name to the place,novel
what is the name of the place? i've never heard of copper beeches before.,chit-chat
i was driven over by my employer who was as amiable as ever and was introduced by him that evening to his wife and the child,novel
that's really nice of him. i'm glad you were able to get to know him.,chit-chat
there was no truth mr holmes in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable in your rooms at baker street,novel
i've never been to baker street. what's it like there? is it nice?,chit-chat
mrs rucastle is not mad,novel
mrs rucastle isn't mad at all. she's a great lady.,chit-chat
i found her to be a silent palefaced woman much younger than her husband not more than thirty i should think while he can hardly be less than fortyfive,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i've never met a woman like that before.,chit-chat
from their conversation i have gathered that they have been married about seven years that he was a widower and that his only child by the first wife was the daughter who has gone to philadelphia,novel
"wow, that's a long time to be married. i've never been married.",chit-chat
mr rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother,novel
that's not good. i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she's doing better now.,chit-chat
as the daughter could not have been less than twenty i can quite imagine that her position must have been uncomfortable with her fathers young wife,novel
i think so too. i think it's a shame that she didn't have a good relationship with her father.,chit-chat
mrs,novel
have you ever been to the united states? it's a sovereign state in north america.,chit-chat
rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in feature,novel
rucastle has been around for a long time. they have been around since the 1980s.,chit-chat
she impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse,novel
that's good to hear. what did she do to make you think she was impressed?,chit-chat
she was a nonentity,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm sorry to hear that.,chit-chat
it was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both to her husband and to her little son,novel
that's really sweet of her. i'm glad she's doing well for herself.,chit-chat
her light grey eyes wandered continually from one to the other noting every little want and forestalling it if possible,novel
i've had that happen to me a few times. it's not fun at all.,chit-chat
he was kind to her also in his bluff boisterous fashion and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple,novel
i don't think i've ever seen him in his bluff boisterous fashion.,chit-chat
and yet she had some secret sorrow this woman,novel
"oh no, what did she say? i'm not familiar with the secret sorrow woman.",chit-chat
she would often be lost in deep thought with the saddest look upon her face,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
more than once i have surprised her in tears,novel
"that's great! i'm sure she's happy for you. what did you surprise her with, if you don't mind me asking?",chit-chat
i have thought sometimes that it was the disposition of her child which weighed upon her mind for i have never met so utterly spoiled and so illnatured a little creature,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do to make her feel that way?,chit-chat
he is small for his age with a head which is quite disproportionately large,novel
that's a shame. i'm sure he'll grow up to be a great player.,chit-chat
his whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between savage fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he's doing well.,chit-chat
giving pain to any creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice little birds and insects,novel
i'm not sure if i could do that. i don't think i'd be able to do it.,chit-chat
but i would rather not talk about the creature mr holmes and indeed he has little to do with my story i am glad of all details remarked my friend whether they seem to you to be relevant or not i shall try not to miss anything of importance,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what's the creature you're talking about?,chit-chat
the one unpleasant thing about the house which struck me at once was the appearance and conduct of the servants,novel
"oh no, i'm sorry to hear that. what did they do to the servants?",chit-chat
there are only two a man and his wife,novel
that's sad. i'm sorry to hear that. do you have any siblings?,chit-chat
toller for that is his name is a rough uncouth man with grizzled hair and whiskers and a perpetual smell of drink,novel
i've never heard of a toller before. what does he do for a living?,chit-chat
twice since i have been with them he has been quite drunk and yet mr rucastle seemed to take no notice of it,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's able to get over it.,chit-chat
his wife is a very tall and strong woman with a sour face as silent as mrs rucastle and much less amiable,novel
i'm not familiar with mrs. rucastle. what does she look like?,chit-chat
they are a most unpleasant couple but fortunately i spend most of my time in the nursery and my own room which are next to each other in one corner of the building,novel
that's really nice of you. i'm glad you're able to do that.,chit-chat
for two days after my arrival at the copper beeches my life was very quiet on the third mrs rucastle came down just after breakfast and whispered something to her husband,novel
"wow, that must have been quite the surprise. did you find out who it was or what?",chit-chat
oh yes said he turning to me we are very much obliged to you miss hunter for falling in with our whims so far as to cut your hair,novel
i'm not sure if i want to cut my hair or not. i don't know what to do with it.,chit-chat
i assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your appearance,novel
that's good to hear. i'm sure i'll look better in the future.,chit-chat
we shall now see how the electricblue dress will become you,novel
"i'm not sure what that means, but i hope it's a good one.",chit-chat
you will find it laid out upon the bed in your room and if you would be so good as to put it on we should both be extremely obliged the dress which i found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of blue,novel
that's a good idea. i'm not sure if i'll be able to put it on though.,chit-chat
it was of excellent material a sort of beige but it bore unmistakable signs of having been worn before,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. did you find out who it was before it was worn?,chit-chat
it could not have been a better fit if i had been measured for it,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do to make it a better fit?,chit-chat
both mr and mrs rucastle expressed a delight at the look of it which seemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence,novel
i didn't see that. what did they say about it? i'm not familiar with rucastle.,chit-chat
they were waiting for me in the drawingroom which is a very large room stretching along the entire front of the house with three long windows reaching down to the floor,novel
"oh wow, that must have been scary. i hope you were able to get out of there quickly.",chit-chat
a chair had been placed close to the central window with its back turned towards it,novel
oh no! did you find out who did it or did you have to call the police?,chit-chat
in this i was asked to sit and then mr rucastle walking up and down on the other side of the room began to tell me a series of the funniest stories that i have ever listened to,novel
that's so funny! what was the funniest story you've ever heard?,chit-chat
you can not imagine how comical he was and i laughed until i was quite weary,novel
i can't imagine how comical he was and i laughed until i was quite tired.,chit-chat
mrs rucastle however who has evidently no sense of humour never so much as smiled but sat with her hands in her lap and a sad anxious look upon her face,novel
i've never heard of mrs rucastle. what does she do for a living?,chit-chat
after an hour or so mr rucastle suddenly remarked that it was time to commence the duties of the day and that i might change my dress and go to little edward in the nursery,novel
oh no! i hope you didn't have to go out of your way to change your dress!,chit-chat
two days later this same performance was gone through under exactly similar circumstances,novel
that's awesome! i'm so happy for you. i hope you're feeling better now.,chit-chat
again i changed my dress again i sat in the window and again i laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which my employer had an immense _répertoire_ and which he told inimitably,novel
that's so funny! i'm glad you're able to laugh about it.,chit-chat
then he handed me a yellowbacked novel and moving my chair a little sideways that my own shadow might not fall upon the page he begged me to read aloud to him,novel
oh no! i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay.,chit-chat
i read for about ten minutes beginning in the heart of a chapter and then suddenly in the middle of a sentence he ordered me to cease and to change my dress,novel
oh no! that's awful! did you end up getting your dress back or did you have to go to court?,chit-chat
you can easily imagine mr holmes how curious i became as to what the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be,novel
i don't think i've ever seen mr. holmes. what's it about?,chit-chat
they were always very careful i observed to turn my face away from the window so that i became consumed with the desire to see what was going on behind my back,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay. what was going on behind your back?,chit-chat
at first it seemed to be impossible but i soon devised a means,novel
that's a good attitude to have. i'm sure you'll do great!,chit-chat
my handmirror had been broken so a happy thought seized me and i concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief,novel
oh no! i'm so sorry to hear that. did you find out who did it?,chit-chat
on the next occasion in the midst of my laughter i put my handkerchief up to my eyes and was able with a little management to see all that there was behind me,novel
that's pretty funny. i'm glad you were able to get it out of your mind.,chit-chat
i confess that i was disappointed,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do to make you feel that way?,chit-chat
there was nothing,novel
that's a bummer. i'm sorry you had to go through that. what happened?,chit-chat
at least that was my first impression,novel
what was your first impression? i don't think i've heard of that before.,chit-chat
at the second glance however i perceived that there was a man standing in the southampton road a small bearded man in a grey suit who seemed to be looking in my direction,novel
that's pretty creepy. what did you do? did you get out of the van?,chit-chat
the road is an important highway and there are usually people there,novel
the road is an important highway and there are usually people there there too. do you like the road?,chit-chat
this man however was leaning against the railings which bordered our field and was looking earnestly up,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he didn't get hurt.,chit-chat
i lowered my handkerchief and glanced at mrs rucastle to find her eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze,novel
that's pretty cool. did you find out who she was or what she looked like?,chit-chat
she said nothing but i am convinced that she had divined that i had a mirror in my hand and had seen what was behind me,novel
"wow, that's crazy. did you confront her about it or did she say something?",chit-chat
she rose at once,novel
i don't think i've ever rose once in my life. i'm not sure what that means.,chit-chat
jephro said she there is an impertinent fellow upon the road there who stares up at miss hunter no friend of yours miss hunter he asked,novel
that's interesting. i'm not familiar with miss hunter. what does she look like?,chit-chat
no i know no one in these parts dear me,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. do you have any friends that you can talk to about it?,chit-chat
how very impertinent,novel
i don't know what i'm going to do with the money i've made.,chit-chat
kindly turn round and motion to him to go away surely it would be better to take no notice no no we should have him loitering here always,novel
that's a good idea. i think i'll do that. i don't know why i didn't think of that.,chit-chat
kindly turn round and wave him away like that i did as i was told and at the same instant mrs rucastle drew down the blind,novel
that's a good idea. i'll do that next time i'm around him.,chit-chat
that was a week ago and from that time i have not sat again in the window nor have i worn the blue dress nor seen the man in the road pray continue said holmes,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay. i've never seen a man in the road before.,chit-chat
your narrative promises to be a most interesting one you will find it rather disconnected i fear and there may prove to be little relation between the different incidents of which i speak,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you talking about something i don't know about?,chit-chat
on the very first day that i was at the copper beeches mr rucastle took me to a small outhouse which stands near the kitchen door,novel
that must have been a fun experience. did you have a good time at the outhouse?,chit-chat
as we approached it i heard the sharp rattling of a chain and the sound as of a large animal moving about,novel
that's scary! did you get out of the car and get back in the car?,chit-chat
look in here said mr rucastle showing me a slit between two planks,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never heard of rucastle. what's his name?,chit-chat
is he not a beauty i looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes and of a vague figure huddled up in the darkness,novel
"i don't think he's a beauty, but i'm not sure what you mean by that.",chit-chat
dont be frightened said my employer laughing at the start which i had given,novel
that's pretty funny. i'm sure you'll be fine. what did they laugh about?,chit-chat
its only carlo my mastiff,novel
that's cool. what kind of dog is it? i've always wanted one.,chit-chat
i call him mine but really old toller my groom is the only man who can do anything with him,novel
that's so sweet of him. i'm sure he's a great man.,chit-chat
we feed him once a day and not too much then so that he is always as keen as mustard,novel
that's a good way to look at it. what kind of food do you feed him?,chit-chat
toller lets him loose every night and god help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs upon,novel
toller lets him loose every night and god help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs upon,chit-chat
for goodness sake dont you ever on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night for its as much as your life is worth the warning was no idle one for two nights later i happened to look out of my bedroom window about two oclock in the morning,novel
oh no! i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're ok.,chit-chat
it was a beautiful moonlight night and the lawn in front of the house was silvered over and almost as bright as day,novel
that sounds like a beautiful night. what did you do to make it look like it was so bright?,chit-chat
i was standing rapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene when i was aware that something was moving under the shadow of the copper beeches,novel
that's so cool! what did you see? did you think it was a ghost?,chit-chat
as it emerged into the moonshine i saw what it was,novel
oh no! what did it look like? did you have to clean it up or anything?,chit-chat
it was a giant dog as large as a calf tawny tinted with hanging jowl black muzzle and huge projecting bones,novel
"wow, that's a big dog. i've never seen one of those before.",chit-chat
it walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon the other side,novel
that's scary! did you find out who it was? did you call the police?,chit-chat
that dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart which i do not think that any burglar could have done,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did he do to make you feel that way?,chit-chat
and now i have a very strange experience to tell you,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what was it that you had to tell me about?,chit-chat
i had as you know cut off my hair in london and i had placed it in a great coil at the bottom of my trunk,novel
oh no! i'm sorry to hear that. did you end up getting it back?,chit-chat
one evening after the child was in bed i began to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little things,novel
"oh my god, that must have been so embarrassing. did you have to clean it up?",chit-chat
there was an old chest of drawers in the room the two upper ones empty and open the lower one locked,novel
"oh wow, that must have been a long time ago. did you find out who did it?",chit-chat
i had filled the first two with my linen and as i had still much to pack away i was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you end up doing with the third drawer?,chit-chat
it struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight so i took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it,novel
oh no! i'm sorry to hear that. did you have to get a new one?,chit-chat
the very first key fitted to perfection and i drew the drawer open,novel
that's awesome! i'm sure you're proud of yourself for doing that.,chit-chat
there was only one thing in it but i am sure that you would never guess what it was,novel
"that's a good point. i'm not sure what it was, but i can't imagine what it would have been.",chit-chat
it was my coil of hair,novel
oh no! what happened to it? did you have to clean it up or do anything?,chit-chat
i took it up and examined it,novel
that's a good thing to do. it's always good to take care of your pets.,chit-chat
it was of the same peculiar tint and the same thickness,novel
that's a bummer. did you have to replace it or did you get a new one?,chit-chat
but then the impossibility of the thing obtruded itself upon me,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what was the thing obtruded to you about?,chit-chat
how could my hair have been locked in the drawer,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do to get it locked in the drawer?,chit-chat
with trembling hands i undid my trunk turned out the contents and drew from the bottom my own hair,novel
oh no! did you have to clean it up? i hope it wasn't too gross.,chit-chat
i laid the two tresses together and i assure you that they were identical,novel
"wow, that's pretty cool. what did you do to make sure they were identical?",chit-chat
was it not extraordinary,novel
i don't think so. i'm not sure if it was just me or not.,chit-chat
puzzle as i would i could make nothing at all of what it meant,novel
that's a good way to look at it. what puzzles do you like to do?,chit-chat
i returned the strange hair to the drawer and i said nothing of the matter to the rucastles as i felt that i had put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had locked,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you say to the rucastles?,chit-chat
i am naturally observant as you may have remarked mr holmes and i soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head,novel
that's awesome! i'm glad you had a good plan for the whole house!,chit-chat
there was one wing however which appeared not to be inhabited at all,novel
"wow, that must have been scary. did you find out who it was or what happened?",chit-chat
a door which faced that which led into the quarters of the tollers opened into this suite but it was invariably locked,novel
"oh wow, that must have been scary. did you find out who did it or what?",chit-chat
one day however as i ascended the stair i met mr rucastle coming out through this door his keys in his hand and a look on his face which made him a very different person to the round jovial man to whom i was accustomed,novel
"wow, that's really cool. did you get to meet him? did you have a good time?",chit-chat
his cheeks were red his brow was all crinkled with anger and the veins stood out at his temples with passion,novel
"wow, that's pretty intense. i'm glad he was able to overcome it.",chit-chat
he locked the door and hurried past me without a word or a look,novel
oh no! that's so scary! did you have to call the police or anything?,chit-chat
this aroused my curiosity so when i went out for a walk in the grounds with my charge i strolled round to the side from which i could see the windows of this part of the house,novel
that's a good way to look at it. did you find out who it was?,chit-chat
there were four of them in a row three of which were simply dirty while the fourth was shuttered up,novel
"wow, that's a lot of people. i'm sorry you had to go through that.",chit-chat
they were evidently all deserted,novel
"that's a bummer. i'm glad they didn't leave, though.",chit-chat
as i strolled up and down glancing at them occasionally mr rucastle came out to me looking as merry and jovial as ever,novel
that's pretty funny. what did you do to make them think you looked like them?,chit-chat
ah said he you must not think me rude if i passed you without a word my dear young lady,novel
i don't think you're rude at all. i'm sure you'll be fine.,chit-chat
i was preoccupied with business matters i assured him that i was not offended,novel
that's good to hear. i'm glad you were able to work with him.,chit-chat
by the way said i you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there and one of them has the shutters up he looked surprised and as it seemed to me a little startled at my remark,novel
oh no! i'm so sorry to hear that. what did you say to him?,chit-chat
photography is one of my hobbies said he,novel
that's cool. what kind of photography do you like to do? i'm a photographer myself.,chit-chat
i have made my dark room up there,novel
what did you do to make it up there? i'm sure you'll be fine.,chit-chat
but dear me,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do to make you feel that way?,chit-chat
what an observant young lady we have come upon,novel
i know right! i was so shocked when i found out she was only 20 years old.,chit-chat
who would have believed it,novel
"i would have believed it, but i didn't think it would be that big of a deal.",chit-chat
who would have ever believed it he spoke in a jesting tone but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at me,novel
why did he look at you in such a jesting way? did you say something to him?,chit-chat
i read suspicion there and annoyance but no jest,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. do you have any other hobbies that you like to do?,chit-chat
well mr holmes from the moment that i understood that there was something about that suite of rooms which i was not to know i was all on fire to go over them,novel
"oh wow, that's interesting. what did you think was going to happen to you?",chit-chat
it was not mere curiosity though i have my share of that,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get it back.,chit-chat
it was more a feeling of dutya feeling that some good might come from my penetrating to this place,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. do you think you'll be able to find a new place soon?,chit-chat
they talk of womans instinct perhaps it was womans instinct which gave me that feeling,novel
i don't think so. i think it's more of a woman's thing.,chit-chat
at any rate it was there and i was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the forbidden door,novel
that's awesome! did you find out who it was or did you just assume it was someone you knew?,chit-chat
it was only yesterday that the chance came,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're feeling better now that it's over.,chit-chat
i may tell you that besides mr rucastle both toller and his wife find something to do in these deserted rooms and i once saw him carrying a large black linen bag with him through the door,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. did you find out who he was or what he was doing?",chit-chat
recently he has been drinking hard and yesterday evening he was very drunk and when i came upstairs there was the key in the door,novel
that's not good. i'm sorry you had to go through that. did you call the police?,chit-chat
i have no doubt at all that he had left it there,novel
that's what i was thinking. i'm glad he didn't leave it there.,chit-chat
mr and mrs rucastle were both downstairs and the child was with them so that i had an admirable opportunity,novel
that's great! i'm glad you had an admirable opportunity. did you have a good time?,chit-chat
i turned the key gently in the lock opened the door and slipped through,novel
oh no! i'm sorry to hear that. did you find out who did it?,chit-chat
there was a little passage in front of me unpapered and uncarpeted which turned at a right angle at the farther end,novel
oh no! that's so scary! did you have to get out of the car?,chit-chat
round this corner were three doors in a line the first and third of which were open,novel
that's pretty cool. how long did it take for you to get to the corner?,chit-chat
they each led into an empty room dusty and cheerless with two windows in the one and one in the other so thick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through them,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. what did you do to get rid of the dirt?,chit-chat
the centre door was closed and across the outside of it had been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall and fastened at the other with stout cord,novel
"wow, that must have been scary. did you have to do anything special to get in?",chit-chat
the door itself was locked as well and the key was not there,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get it fixed.,chit-chat
this barricaded door corresponded clearly with the shuttered window outside and yet i could see by the glimmer from beneath it that the room was not in darkness,novel
that's pretty scary. did you find out who did it or did you have to call the police?,chit-chat
evidently there was a skylight which let in light from above,novel
that's interesting. i've never seen a skylight like that before. are you sure it wasn't a ghost?,chit-chat
as i stood in the passage gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it might veil i suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room and saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the little slit of dim light which shone out from under the door,novel
"oh my god, that's terrifying! i'm glad you were able to escape!",chit-chat
a mad unreasoning terror rose up in me at the sight mr holmes,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're ok. what did you do?,chit-chat
my overstrung nerves failed me suddenly and i turned and ranran as though some dreadful hand were behind me clutching at the skirt of my dress,novel
oh no! i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay.,chit-chat
i rushed down the passage through the door and straight into the arms of mr rucastle who was waiting outside,novel
"oh my god, that's so scary! what did mr rucastle do?",chit-chat
so said he smiling it was you then,novel
"no, it was just a smile. i was so happy to see him smile. it was so nice of him.",chit-chat
i thought that it must be when i saw the door open oh i am so frightened i panted,novel
i would have been too. what did you do to make it up to him / her?,chit-chat
my dear young lady,novel
i love my dear young lady as well. it's such a beautiful thing to see.,chit-chat
my dear young ladyyou can not think how caressing and soothing his manner wasand what has frightened you my dear young lady but his voice was just a little too coaxing,novel
my dear ladyyou can not think how caressing and soothing his manner wasand what frightened you my dear young lady but his voice was just a little too xing,chit-chat
he overdid it,novel
i don't think so. i think he just didn't know what he was doing.,chit-chat
i was keenly on my guard against him,novel
that's pretty cool. what did you do to him to get him to do that?,chit-chat
i was foolish enough to go into the empty wing i answered,novel
oh no! did you get the answer you wanted or did you have to do something else?,chit-chat
but it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that i was frightened and ran out again,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. do you think you'll be able to go back?,chit-chat
oh it is so dreadfully still in there only that said he looking at me keenly,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get it fixed.,chit-chat
why what did you think i asked,novel
i didn't know what you were talking about. what did you think i was talking about?,chit-chat
why do you think that i lock this door i am sure that i do not know it is to keep people out who have no business there,novel
"that's a good point, i've never thought of that before. i'll have to think about that.",chit-chat
do you see he was still smiling in the most amiable manner,novel
i don't think so. i think he just doesn't know how to smile.,chit-chat
i am sure if i had known well then you know now,novel
that's a good way to look at it. it's hard to tell sometimes.,chit-chat
and if you ever put your foot over that threshold againhere in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of rage and he glared down at me with the face of a demonill throw you to the mastiff i was so terrified that i do not know what i did,novel
"oh my god, that's terrifying! i'm so sorry you had to experience that!",chit-chat
i suppose that i must have rushed past him into my room,novel
that's a good idea. i would have done the same if i was in your shoes.,chit-chat
i remember nothing until i found myself lying on my bed trembling all over,novel
oh no! i'm sorry to hear that. did you find out who it was?,chit-chat
then i thought of you mr holmes,novel
what did you think of mr. holmes? i'm not sure what you mean by that.,chit-chat
i could not live there longer without some advice,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what kind of advice would you like to give me?,chit-chat
i was frightened of the house of the man of the woman of the servants even of the child,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what made you scared of the house of the man of the woman of the servants?,chit-chat
they were all horrible to me,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did they do to make you feel that way?,chit-chat
if i could only bring you down all would be well,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what would you like to do to bring you down all?,chit-chat
of course i might have fled from the house but my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you were able to get out of the house.,chit-chat
my mind was soon made up,novel
what did you think was going to happen? did you have a good reason for doing it?,chit-chat
i would send you a wire,novel
that would be great! thank you so much! i really appreciate it. i'm so grateful!,chit-chat
i put on my hat and cloak went down to the office which is about half a mile from the house and then returned feeling very much easier,novel
that's great! i'm glad it worked out for you. what did you do for fun?,chit-chat
a horrible doubt came into my mind as i approached the door lest the dog might be loose but i remembered that toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that evening and i knew that he was the only one in the household who had any influence with the savage creature or who would venture to set him free,novel
"oh no, that's terrible. i'm so sorry you had to go through that.",chit-chat
i slipped in in safety and lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you,novel
that's really nice of you to do. i'm glad you were able to see me.,chit-chat
i had no difficulty in getting leave to come into winchester this morning but i must be back before three oclock for mr and mrs rucastle are going on a visit and will be away all the evening so that i must look after the child,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun! i'm sure you'll have a great time.,chit-chat
now i have told you all my adventures mr holmes and i should be very glad if you could tell me what it all means and above all what i should do holmes and i had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story,novel
i've never heard of spellbound before. what's the name of the story?,chit-chat
my friend rose now and paced up and down the room his hands in his pockets and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad he's doing well. what did he do?,chit-chat
is toller still drunk he asked,novel
"no, he's fine. i'm sure he'll be fine, though.",chit-chat
yes,novel
i love to go to the beach. it's a great place to relax and have a good time.,chit-chat
i heard his wife tell mrs rucastle that she could do nothing with him that is well,novel
i don't think i've ever heard of mrs rucastle. who is she?,chit-chat
and the rucastles go out tonight yes is there a cellar with a good strong lock yes the winecellar you seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave and sensible girl miss hunter,novel
thank you so much! i'm so proud of you for doing what you're doing.,chit-chat
do you think that you could perform one more feat,novel
"i think i could, but i'm not sure if i'd be able to.",chit-chat
i should not ask it of you if i did not think you a quite exceptional woman i will try,novel
that's nice of you to say. i'm sure you'll have a great time.,chit-chat
what is it we shall be at the copper beeches by seven oclock my friend and i,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. i hope you guys have a great time. what are you going to do?,chit-chat
the rucastles will be gone by that time and toller will we hope be incapable,novel
i hope so too. it's been a long time since i've been there.,chit-chat
there only remains mrs toller who might give the alarm,novel
that's a good idea. i think i'm going to have to do that.,chit-chat
if you could send her into the cellar on some errand and then turn the key upon her you would facilitate matters immensely i will do it excellent,novel
that's a good idea. i'm not sure if i'd be able to do that though.,chit-chat
we shall then look thoroughly into the affair,novel
that's a good idea. i think i'm going to have to do that.,chit-chat
of course there is only one feasible explanation,novel
what is the feasible explanation? i don't know what i'm talking about.,chit-chat
you have been brought there to personate someone and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you saying that you have been there to personate someone and the real person is in this chamber?,chit-chat
that is obvious,novel
i don't think i've ever seen it before. i'm not sure what it is.,chit-chat
as to who this prisoner is i have no doubt that it is the daughter miss alice rucastle if i remember right who was said to have gone to america,novel
"i don't know who that is, but i do know that she was a child molester.",chit-chat
you were chosen doubtless as resembling her in height figure and the colour of your hair,novel
"i'm not sure what color my hair is, but i've always wanted to dye it.",chit-chat
hers had been cut off very possibly in some illness through which she has passed and so of course yours had to be sacrificed also,novel
i'm sorry to hear about your loss. i hope she's doing better now.,chit-chat
by a curious chance you came upon her tresses,novel
"yes, i did. i was so happy when i found out it was her and not me.",chit-chat
the man in the road was undoubtedly some friend of herspossibly her _fiancé_and no doubt as you wore the girls dress and were so like her he was convinced from your laughter whenever he saw you and afterwards from your gesture that miss rucastle was perfectly happy and that she no longer desired his attentions,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. i've never heard of a man in the road before.",chit-chat
the dog is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicate with her,novel
"that's a good way to look at it. what kind of dog is it, if you don't mind me asking?",chit-chat
so much is fairly clear,novel
i'm glad to hear that. it's been a long time since i've been in a relationship.,chit-chat
the most serious point in the case is the disposition of the child what on earth has that to do with it i ejaculated,novel
i agree. i don't think i could do that to a child. it's so gross.,chit-chat
my dear watson you as a medical man are continually gaining light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents,novel
"i'm not a medical man, but i do have a sister who is. she's a bit of a sociopath.",chit-chat
dont you see that the converse is equally valid,novel
i don't understand what you mean by that. are you saying that the converse is true?,chit-chat
i have frequently gained my first real insight into the character of parents by studying their children,novel
that's a great way to look at it. i'm sure you're a great parent.,chit-chat
this childs disposition is abnormally cruel merely for crueltys sake and whether he derives this from his smiling father as i should suspect or from his mother it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their power i am sure that you are right mr holmes cried our client,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope he's able to get help.,chit-chat
a thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have hit it,novel
i've never heard of that song before. what kind of things do you like to listen to?,chit-chat
oh let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor creature we must be circumspect for we are dealing with a very cunning man,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get the help you need.,chit-chat
we can do nothing until seven oclock,novel
what are you going to do at 7 oclock? i'm not sure i can do that.,chit-chat
at that hour we shall be with you and it will not be long before we solve the mystery we were as good as our word for it was just seven when we reached the copper beeches having put up our trap at a wayside publichouse,novel
"wow, that's a long time. i'm sorry you had to go through that.",chit-chat
the group of trees with their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in the light of the setting sun were sufficient to mark the house even had miss hunter not been standing smiling on the doorstep,novel
i love miss hunter. she's my favorite character in the series. what's your favorite character?,chit-chat
have you managed it asked holmes,novel
"i haven't yet, but i'm sure i'll find out soon enough.",chit-chat
a loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs,novel
oh no! what did you do to make it sound like it was coming from somewhere down there?,chit-chat
that is mrs toller in the cellar said she,novel
that is mrs. toller in the cellar said she she... what did she say?,chit-chat
her husband lies snoring on the kitchen rug,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did he do to make you think he did that?,chit-chat
here are his keys which are the duplicates of mr rucastles you have done well indeed cried holmes with enthusiasm,novel
"i'm not sure what you mean by that, but thank you for your kind words.",chit-chat
now lead the way and we shall soon see the end of this black business we passed up the stair unlocked the door followed on down a passage and found ourselves in front of the barricade which miss hunter had described,novel
"oh my god, that's so scary! i'm so sorry you had to go through that.",chit-chat
holmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar,novel
holmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar? is that what you do for a living?,chit-chat
then he tried the various keys in the lock but without success,novel
that's what i was thinking. i'm glad he didn't do that.,chit-chat
no sound came from within and at the silence holmes face clouded over,novel
oh no! that must have been so scary! did you have to go to the hospital?,chit-chat
i trust that we are not too late said he,novel
that's good to hear. it's always good to be confident in your abilities.,chit-chat
i think miss hunter that we had better go in without you,novel
i think miss hunter that we had better go in without you would have been a great show.,chit-chat
now watson put your shoulder to it and we shall see whether we can not make our way in it was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united strength,novel
i can't wait to see how it turns out. i'm sure it's going to be a lot of fun.,chit-chat
together we rushed into the room,novel
that's nice. what did you guys end up doing in the middle of the night?,chit-chat
it was empty,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do to make it a little better?,chit-chat
there was no furniture save a little pallet bed a small table and a basketful of linen,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do to get rid of the pallet bed?,chit-chat
the skylight above was open and the prisoner gone,novel
"oh no, i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're ok.",chit-chat
there has been some villainy here said holmes this beauty has guessed miss hunters intentions and has carried his victim off but how through the skylight,novel
"i've never heard of holmes, but i'm familiar with miss hunters. have you?",chit-chat
we shall soon see how he managed it he swung himself up onto the roof,novel
oh no! that's terrible! i hope he's ok. i'm sure he'll be fine.,chit-chat
ah yes he cried heres the end of a long light ladder against the eaves,novel
that's what i was thinking. i don't know what i would do if that happened to me.,chit-chat
that is how he did it but it is impossible said miss hunter the ladder was not there when the rucastles went away he has come back and done it,novel
that's good to hear. i'm glad he came back and did it again.,chit-chat
i tell you that he is a clever and dangerous man,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad you think so.,chit-chat
i should not be very much surprised if this were he whose step i hear now upon the stair,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get him back.,chit-chat
i think watson that it would be as well for you to have your pistol ready the words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the door of the room a very fat and burly man with a heavy stick in his hand,novel
"i'm not sure what you're trying to say, but i don't know what you mean.",chit-chat
miss hunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of him but sherlock holmes sprang forward and confronted him,novel
"oh my god, sherlock holmes is the best detective in the whole world. i'm so glad he's gone.",chit-chat
you villain said he wheres your daughter the fat man cast his eyes round and then up at the open skylight,novel
hahahaha... that's so funny. i'm laughing so hard right now.,chit-chat
it is for me to ask you that he shrieked you thieves,novel
i don't know... i'm not sure what to do about it.,chit-chat
spies and thieves,novel
have you ever heard of spy and thieves? it's a group of people who spy on another person.,chit-chat
i have caught you have i,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you referring to something i've never heard of before?,chit-chat
you are in my power,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're having a good day today.,chit-chat
ill serve you he turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he could go,novel
that's not good. i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do?,chit-chat
hes gone for the dog cried miss hunter,novel
"aww, i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope he's ok.",chit-chat
i have my revolver said i,novel
that's cool. what kind of gun do you have? i've never had one.,chit-chat
better close the front door cried holmes and we all rushed down the stairs together,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. what did you guys end up doing after the fight?,chit-chat
we had hardly reached the hall when we heard the baying of a hound and then a scream of agony with a horrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to,novel
oh no! i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay.,chit-chat
an elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door,novel
"oh wow, that must have been scary. did you see him at all? did you call the police?",chit-chat
my god he cried,novel
what did he cry about? i don't think i've ever seen someone cry like that before.,chit-chat
someone has loosed the dog,novel
that's what i'm thinking too. i can't imagine losing my dog.,chit-chat
its not been fed for two days,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. do you have any idea what's going on?,chit-chat
quick quick or itll be too late holmes and i rushed out and round the angle of the house with toller hurrying behind us,novel
that's not a bad idea. i'm glad you didn't get hurt.,chit-chat
there was the huge famished brute its black muzzle buried in rucastles throat while he writhed and screamed upon the ground,novel
"wow, that must have been scary. did you find out who it was or what happened?",chit-chat
running up i blew its brains out and it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck,novel
oh no! i'm so sorry to hear that. what did you do about it?,chit-chat
with much labour we separated them and carried him living but horribly mangled into the house,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find him.,chit-chat
we laid him upon the drawingroom sofa and having dispatched the sobered toller to bear the news to his wife i did what i could to relieve his pain,novel
that's really sweet of you. i'm glad you were able to relieve his pain.,chit-chat
we were all assembled round him when the door opened and a tall gaunt woman entered the room,novel
"oh wow, that must have been so embarrassing. i hope you were able to get out of there quickly.",chit-chat
mrs,novel
have you ever been to the united states? it's a sovereign state in north america.,chit-chat
toller cried miss hunter,novel
have you ever watched miss hunter? it's one of my favorite shows. have you seen it?,chit-chat
yes miss,novel
what do you like to do in your spare time? i'm always looking for new things to do.,chit-chat
mr rucastle let me out when he came back before he went up to you,novel
i love mr. rucastle! he's my favorite cat. what did he do?,chit-chat
ah miss it is a pity you didnt let me know what you were planning for i would have told you that your pains were wasted ha said holmes looking keenly at her,novel
haha... that's a good one. i'm not sure what to do with myself.,chit-chat
it is clear that mrs toller knows more about this matter than anyone else yes sir i do and i am ready enough to tell what i know then pray sit down and let us hear it for there are several points on which i must confess that i am still in the dark i will soon make it clear to you said she and id have done so before now if i could ha got out from the cellar,novel
that's a good idea. i'm sure you'll be able to get out.,chit-chat
if theres policecourt business over this youll remember that i was the one that stood your friend and that i was miss alices friend too,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're doing better now. what happened?,chit-chat
she was never happy at home miss alice wasnt from the time that her father married again,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. that must have been hard for her. did she ever get married again?,chit-chat
she was slighted like and had no say in anything but it never really became bad for her until after she met mr fowler at a friends house,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did she do to get slighted like that?,chit-chat
as well as i could learn miss alice had rights of her own by will but she was so quiet and patient she was that she never said a word about them but just left everything in mr rucastles hands,novel
i'm not familiar with mr rucastles. what does he do for a living?,chit-chat
he knew he was safe with her but when there was a chance of a husband coming forward who would ask for all that the law would give him then her father thought it time to put a stop on it,novel
that's terrible. i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope he's doing better now.,chit-chat
he wanted her to sign a paper so that whether she married or not he could use her money,novel
that's not good. i'm sorry to hear that. what did he do?,chit-chat
when she wouldnt do it he kept on worrying her until she got brainfever and for six weeks was at deaths door,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find peace.,chit-chat
then she got better at last all worn to a shadow and with her beautiful hair cut off but that didnt make no change in her young man and he stuck to her as true as man could be ah said holmes i think that what you have been good enough to tell us makes the matter fairly clear and that i can deduce all that remains,novel
that's a great way to look at it. i think you're right about that.,chit-chat
mr rucastle then i presume took to this system of imprisonment yes sir and brought miss hunter down from london in order to get rid of the disagreeable persistence of mr fowler that was it sir but mr fowler being a persevering man as a good seaman should be blockaded the house and having met you succeeded by certain arguments metallic or otherwise in convincing you that your interests were the same as his mr,novel
i'm sorry to hear that mr. rucastle. i hope you're ok.,chit-chat
fowler was a very kindspoken freehanded gentleman said mrs toller serenely,novel
that's very nice of him. i've never heard of him before. what did he say?,chit-chat
and in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of drink and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master had gone out you have it sir just as it happened i am sure we owe you an apology mrs toller said holmes for you have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us,novel
thank you for your kind words. i appreciate it. i'm not sure what to do now.,chit-chat
and here comes the country surgeon and mrs rucastle so i think watson that we had best escort miss hunter back to winchester as it seems to me that our _locus standi_ now is rather a questionable one and thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper beeches in front of the door,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. did you find out who she was or who she is?",chit-chat
mr rucastle survived but was always a broken man kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife,novel
that's really sad to hear. i'm sorry to hear that. what happened to him?,chit-chat
they still live with their old servants who probably know so much of rucastles past life that he finds it difficult to part from them,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think of that. do you think they're still living with them?,chit-chat
mr fowler and miss rucastle were married by special license in southampton the day after their flight and he is now the holder of a government appointment in the island of mauritius,novel
"wow, that must have been a long time ago. did they have a good time together?",chit-chat
as to miss violet hunter my friend holmes rather to my disappointment manifested no further interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one of his problems and she is now the head of a private school at walsall where i believe that she has met with considerable success,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she's doing better now. is she doing well now?,chit-chat
end of the project gutenberg ebook the adventures of sherlock holmes updated editions will replace the previous onethe old editions will be renamed,novel
"i love the adventures of sherlock holmes, it's one of my favorite books. have you read it?",chit-chat
