"wow, that's a lot of work. i'm not sure i could do it.",chit-chat
scepticism is as much the result of knowledge as knowledge is of scepticism,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure i'd call it knowledge though.,chit-chat
to be content with what we at present know is for the most part to shut our ears against conviction since from the very gradual character of our education we must continually forget and emancipate ourselves from knowledge previously acquired we must set aside old notions and embrace fresh ones and as we learn we must be daily unlearning something which it has cost us no small labour and anxiety to acquire,novel
that's a great way to look at it. i'm not sure i've ever felt that way before.,chit-chat
and this difficulty attaches itself more closely to an age in which progress has gained a strong ascendency over prejudice and in which persons and things are day by day finding their real level in lieu of their conventional value,novel
that's a great way to look at it. i'm glad to hear that.,chit-chat
the same principles which have swept away traditional abuses and which are making rapid havoc among the revenues of sinecurists and stripping the thin tawdry veil from attractive superstitions are working as actively in literature as in society,novel
"i don't know much about the sinecurists, but i do know that there are a lot of them.",chit-chat
the credulity of one writer or the partiality of another finds as powerful a touchstone and as wholesome a chastisement in the healthy scepticism of a temperate class of antagonists as the dreams of conservatism or the impostures of pluralist sinecures in the church,novel
"what do you mean by "" the credulity of one writer or the partiality of another finds as powerful a touchstone and as wholesome a chastisement in the healthy scepticism of a temperate class of antagonists as the dreams of conservatism or the impostures of pluralist sinecures in the church?",chit-chat
history and tradition whether of ancient or comparatively recent times are subjected to very different handling from that which the indulgence or credulity of former ages could allow,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure i'd agree with you on that one.,chit-chat
mere statements are jealously watched and the motives of the writer form as important an ingredient in the analysis of his history as the facts he records,novel
that's a good way to look at it. do you have a favorite writer you like?,chit-chat
probability is a powerful and troublesome test and it is by this troublesome standard that a large portion of historical evidence is sifted,novel
i'm not sure i understand what you're saying. are you saying that there is a large portion of historical evidence that is sifted?,chit-chat
consistency is no less pertinacious and exacting in its demands,novel
that's a good point. i think it's important to be consistent in your work.,chit-chat
in brief to write a history we must know more than mere facts,novel
that's a good way to look at it. what facts do you want to know?,chit-chat
human nature viewed under an induction of extended experience is the best help to the criticism of human history,novel
"i agree. i think it's important to be critical of human history, as well as human nature.",chit-chat
historical characters can only be estimated by the standard which human experience whether actual or traditionary has furnished,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure if i've ever had a traditionary experience.,chit-chat
to form correct views of individuals we must regard them as forming parts of a great wholewe must measure them by their relation to the mass of beings by whom they are surrounded and in contemplating the incidents in their lives or condition which tradition has handed down to us we must rather consider the general bearing of the whole narrative than the respective probability of its details,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm not sure i agree with that.,chit-chat
it is unfortunate for us that of some of the greatest men we know least and talk most,novel
i agree. it's a shame that some of the greatest men we know have died.,chit-chat
homer socrates and shakespere1 have perhaps contributed more to the intellectual enlightenment of mankind than any other three writers who could be named and yet the history of all three has given rise to a boundless ocean of discussion which has left us little save the option of choosing which theory or theories we will follow,novel
homer socrates and shakespere1 have perhaps contributed more to the intellectual enlightenment of mankind than any other three writers who could be named and yet the history of all three has given rise to a boundless ocean of discussion which has left us little save the option of which theory or theories we will follow,chit-chat
the personality of shakespere is perhaps the only thing in which critics will allow us to believe without controversy but upon everything else even down to the authorship of plays there is more or less of doubt and uncertainty,novel
that's a very good point. i'm not sure i've ever seen a play that i didn't like.,chit-chat
of socrates we know as little as the contradictions of plato and xenophon will allow us to know,novel
i'm not familiar with socrates. what contradictions do you know about plato and xenophon?,chit-chat
he was one of the _dramatis personæ_ in two dramas as unlike in principles as in style,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of him before. what's his name?,chit-chat
he appears as the enunciator of opinions as different in their tone as those of the writers who have handed them down,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm not a big fan of him though.,chit-chat
when we have read plato _or_ xenophon we think we know something of socrates when we have fairly read and examined both we feel convinced that we are something worse than ignorant,novel
i don't think we're worse than ignorant. we just have a different perspective.,chit-chat
it has been an easy and a popular expedient of late years to deny the personal or real existence of men and things whose life and condition were too much for our belief,novel
that's very true. it's hard to believe that there are still so many men out there.,chit-chat
this systemwhich has often comforted the religious sceptic and substituted the consolations of strauss for those of the new testamenthas been of incalculable value to the historical theorists of the last and present centuries,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you referring to the historical theorists?,chit-chat
to question the existence of alexander the great would be a more excusable act than to believe in that of romulus,novel
i don't think so. alexander the great is a historical figure from the middle ages.,chit-chat
to deny a fact related in herodotus because it is inconsistent with a theory developed from an assyrian inscription which no two scholars read in the same way is more pardonable than to believe in the goodnatured old king whom the elegant pen of florian has idealized_numa pompilius_ scepticism has attained its culminating point with respect to homer and the state of our homeric knowledge may be described as a free permission to believe any theory provided we throw overboard all written tradition concerning the author or authors of the iliad and odyssey,novel
i'm not familiar with herodotus. what's it about? i've never heard of it.,chit-chat
what few authorities exist on the subject are summarily dismissed although the arguments appear to run in a circle,novel
"i don't know about you, but i've never been dismissed from a court of law.",chit-chat
this can not be true because it is not true and that is not true because it can not be true such seems to be the style in which testimony upon testimony statement upon statement is consigned to denial and oblivion,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. do you mean that it's not true because it can't be true?,chit-chat
it is however unfortunate that the professed biographies of homer are partly forgeries partly freaks of ingenuity and imagination in which truth is the requisite most wanting,novel
"i don't think i'm a forgerie, but i agree with you.",chit-chat
before taking a brief review of the homeric theory in its present conditions some notice must be taken of the treatise on the life of homer which has been attributed to herodotus,novel
i've never heard of herodotus. what does he say about homeric theory?,chit-chat
according to this document the city of cumæ in æolia was at an early period the seat of frequent immigrations from various parts of greece,novel
that's interesting. i've never been to æolia. do you know much about it?,chit-chat
among the immigrants was menapolus the son of ithagenes,novel
that's interesting. do you know who the son of ithagenes was?,chit-chat
although poor he married and the result of the union was a girl named critheïs,novel
that's so sad. i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's doing better now.,chit-chat
the girl was left an orphan at an early age under the guardianship of cleanax of argos,novel
that's terrible. i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she's okay.,chit-chat
it is to the indiscretion of this maiden that we are indebted for so much happiness homer was the first fruit of her juvenile frailty and received the name of melesigenes from having been born near the river meles in bœotia whither critheïs had been transported in order to save her reputation,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. i've never heard of homer before. what is his name?",chit-chat
at this time continues our narrative there lived at smyrna a man named phemius a teacher of literature and music who not being married engaged critheïs to manage his household and spin the flax he received as the price of his scholastic labours,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i've never heard of smyrna. what's it about?",chit-chat
so satisfactory was her performance of this task and so modest her conduct that he made proposals of marriage declaring himself as a further inducement willing to adopt her son who he asserted would become a clever man if he were carefully brought up they were married careful cultivation ripened the talents which nature had bestowed and melesigenes soon surpassed his schoolfellows in every attainment and when older rivalled his preceptor in wisdom,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i'm not sure if i would want to be married.",chit-chat
phemius died leaving him sole heir to his property and his mother soon followed,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. phemius was such a great character. he was such an amazing character.,chit-chat
melesigenes carried on his adopted fathers school with great success exciting the admiration not only of the inhabitants of smyrna but also of the strangers whom the trade carried on there especially in the exportation of corn attracted to that city,novel
"i've never heard of melesigenes, but i know he's from smyrna.",chit-chat
among these visitors one mentes from leucadia the modern santa maura who evinced a knowledge and intelligence rarely found in those times persuaded melesigenes to close his school and accompany him on his travels,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i've never heard of melesigenes before.",chit-chat
he promised not only to pay his expenses but to furnish him with a further stipend urging that while he was yet young it was fitting that he should see with his own eyes the countries and cities which might hereafter be the subjects of his discourses melesigenes consented and set out with his patron examining all the curiosities of the countries they visited and informing himself of everything by interrogating those whom he met we may also suppose that he wrote memoirs of all that he deemed worthy of preservation,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. i've never read a book like that before.",chit-chat
2 having set sail from tyrrhenia and iberia they reached ithaca,novel
"that's amazing! i've never been to ithaca, but i'd love to go.",chit-chat
here melesigenes who had already suffered in his eyes became much worse and mentes who was about to leave for leucadia left him to the medical superintendence of a friend of his named mentor the son of alcinor,novel
"wow, that's so sad. melesigenes is such a great character.",chit-chat
under his hospitable and intelligent host melesigenes rapidly became acquainted with the legends respecting ulysses which afterwards formed the subject of the odyssey,novel
i love the odyssey! it's one of my favorite music genres. have you heard of it?,chit-chat
the inhabitants of ithaca assert that it was here that melesigenes became blind but the colophomans make their city the seat of that misfortune,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. i've never heard of ithaca before.",chit-chat
he then returned to smyrna where he applied himself to the study of poetry,novel
that's really cool. i've never heard of smyrna. what's it like?,chit-chat
3 but poverty soon drove him to cumæ,novel
i am sorry to hear that. i hope you are able to find a way to help him.,chit-chat
having passed over the hermæan plain he arrived at neon teichos the new wall a colony of cumæ,novel
"wow, that must have been a long time ago. i'm sorry to hear that.",chit-chat
here his misfortunes and poetical talent gained him the friendship of one tychias an armourer,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he's doing well.,chit-chat
and up to my time continued the author the inhabitants showed the place where he used to sit when giving a recitation of his verses and they greatly honoured the spot,novel
that's really cool. i've never heard of that before. what was it about?,chit-chat
here also a poplar grew which they said had sprung up ever since melesigenes arrived,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i've never heard of a poplar before.",chit-chat
4 but poverty still drove him on and he went by way of larissa as being the most convenient road,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he can find a way to make it back on his own.,chit-chat
here the cumans say he composed an epitaph on gordius king of phrygia which has however and with greater probability been attributed to cleobulus of lindus,novel
i've never heard of cleobulus of lindus. is he a legend?,chit-chat
5 arrived at cumæ he frequented the _converzationes_6 of the old men and delighted all by the charms of his poetry,novel
"wow, that's a lot of people. did you have a good time with them?",chit-chat
encouraged by this favourable reception he declared that if they would allow him a public maintenance he would render their city most gloriously renowned,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm sure he's proud of you for doing that.,chit-chat
they avowed their willingness to support him in the measure he proposed and procured him an audience in the council,novel
"wow, that's amazing! i'm so happy for him. i hope he's doing well.",chit-chat
having made the speech with the purport of which our author has forgotten to acquaint us he retired and left them to debate respecting the answer to be given to his proposal,novel
that's a bummer. i'm sorry to hear that. what was the proposal about?,chit-chat
the greater part of the assembly seemed favourable to the poets demand but one man observed that if they were to feed _homers_ they would be encumbered with a multitude of useless people from this circumstance says the writer melesigenes acquired the name of homer for the cumans call blind men _homers_7 with a love of economy which shows how similar the world has always been in its treatment of literary men the pension was denied and the poet vented his disappointment in a wish that cumæa might never produce a poet capable of giving it renown and glory,novel
i've never heard of homer for the cumans. what's the name of the poet?,chit-chat
at phocœa homer was destined to experience another literary distress,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
one thestorides who aimed at the reputation of poetical genius kept homer in his own house and allowed him a pittance on condition of the verses of the poet passing in his name,novel
that's really interesting. i've never heard of homer. what was his name?,chit-chat
having collected sufficient poetry to be profitable thestorides like some wouldbeliterary publishers neglected the man whose brains he had sucked and left him,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. do you have a favorite poet you like to read?",chit-chat
at his departure homer is said to have observed o thestorides of the many things hidden from the knowledge of man nothing is more unintelligible than the human heart8 homer continued his career of difficulty and distress until some chian merchants struck by the similarity of the verses they heard him recite acquainted him with the fact that thestorides was pursuing a profitable livelihood by the recital of the very same poems,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i've never heard of a heart8 homer before.",chit-chat
this at once determined him to set out for chios,novel
that's awesome! what did he do with the money? did he get a promotion?,chit-chat
no vessel happened then to be setting sail thither but he found one ready to start for erythræ a town of ionia which faces that island and he prevailed upon the seamen to allow him to accompany them,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i've never heard of erythræ before.",chit-chat
having embarked he invoked a favourable wind and prayed that he might be able to expose the imposture of thestorides who by his breach of hospitality had drawn down the wrath of jove the hospitable,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. i'm sure you'll have a great time.,chit-chat
at erythræ homer fortunately met with a person who had known him in phocœa by whose assistance he at length after some difficulty reached the little hamlet of pithys,novel
that's really cool. i've never met anyone like that before. did you get to meet him?,chit-chat
here he met with an adventure which we will continue in the words of our author,novel
that's great! what kind of adventure is it? i'm looking forward to it.,chit-chat
having set out from pithys homer went on attracted by the cries of some goats that were pasturing,novel
that's so sad. i'm sorry you had to go through that. did you have a good time?,chit-chat
the dogs barked on his approach and he cried out,novel
oh no! what did you do? did you tell him to get out of the way?,chit-chat
glaucus for that was the name of the goatherd heard his voice ran up quickly called off his dogs and drove them away from homer,novel
i love glaucus! he's one of my favorite fictional characters. what's your favorite character?,chit-chat
for some time he stood wondering how a blind man should have reached such a place alone and what could be his design in coming,novel
"oh wow, that's really interesting. did you ever find out what his design was?",chit-chat
he then went up to him and inquired who he was and how he had come to desolate places and untrodden spots and of what he stood in need,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he's doing well now.,chit-chat
homer by recounting to him the whole history of his misfortunes moved him with compassion and he took him and led him to his cot and having lit a fire bade him sup,novel
homer by recounting to him the whole history of his misfortunes moved him with compassion and he took him and led him to his cot and having lit a fire bade him sup,chit-chat
9 the dogs instead of eating kept barking at the stranger according to their usual habit,novel
"wow, that's a lot of dogs. i've never had a dog before.",chit-chat
whereupon homer addressed glaucus thus o glaucus my friend prythee attend to my behest,novel
i've never heard of a glaucus before. what does it look like to you?,chit-chat
first give the dogs their supper at the doors of the hut for so it is better since whilst they watch nor thief nor wild beast will approach the fold,novel
"that's a good idea, i'll have to try that. what kind of dogs do you have?",chit-chat
glaucus was pleased with the advice and marvelled at its author,novel
glaucus was pleased with the advice and marvelled at its author. what advice?,chit-chat
having finished supper they banqueted10 afresh on conversation homer narrating his wanderings and telling of the cities he had visited,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. what did homer say about the city he was visiting?,chit-chat
at length they retired to rest but on the following morning glaucus resolved to go to his master and acquaint him with his meeting with homer,novel
i love glaucus! he's such a great character. i wish he was still around.,chit-chat
having left the goats in charge of a fellowservant he left homer at home promising to return quickly,novel
"wow, that must have been a lot of work. how long did it take for him to return?",chit-chat
having arrived at bolissus a place near the farm and finding his mate he told him the whole story respecting homer and his journey,novel
that's really cool. did you have a good time? did you get to meet any interesting people?,chit-chat
he paid little attention to what he said and blamed glaucus for his stupidity in taking in and feeding maimed and enfeebled persons,novel
glaucus is such a terrible player. i hope he doesn't have to deal with that for the rest of his life.,chit-chat
however he bade him bring the stranger to him,novel
that's a good idea. i think i'm going to do that next time.,chit-chat
glaucus told homer what had taken place and bade him follow him assuring him that good fortune would be the result,novel
i love glaucus! he is one of my favorite fictional characters. do you have a favorite character?,chit-chat
conversation soon showed that the stranger was a man of much cleverness and general knowledge and the chian persuaded him to remain and to undertake the charge of his children,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of the chian before. what's his name?,chit-chat
11 besides the satisfaction of driving the impostor thestorides from the island homer enjoyed considerable success as a teacher,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun! did you have a good time with the impostor?,chit-chat
in the town of chios he established a school where he taught the precepts of poetry,novel
that's really cool. i've always wanted to go to a school like that.,chit-chat
to this day says chandler12 the most curious remaining is that which has been named without reason the school of homer,novel
chandler12 has been around for a long time. it was founded in 1891.,chit-chat
it is on the coast at some distance from the city northward and appears to have been an open temple of cybele formed on the top of a rock,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. did you find out who it was or what it was?",chit-chat
the shape is oval and in the centre is the image of the goddess the head and an arm wanting,novel
that's really interesting. i've never heard of that before. what is it?,chit-chat
she is represented as usual sitting,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. do you think she's going to make it?,chit-chat
the chair has a lion carved on each side and on the back,novel
"wow, that's pretty cool. i've never seen a lion on a chair before.",chit-chat
the area is bounded by a low rim or seat and about five yards over,novel
"wow, that's a long way from where i live. i'm sorry to hear that.",chit-chat
the whole is hewn out of the mountain is rude indistinct and probably of the most remote antiquity so successful was this school that homer realised a considerable fortune,novel
i'm not familiar with homer. what's the name of the school you're referring to?,chit-chat
he married and had two daughters one of whom died single the other married a chian,novel
"wow, that's so sad. i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's doing better now.",chit-chat
the following passage betrays the same tendency to connect the personages of the poems with the history of the poet which has already been mentioned in his poetical compositions homer displays great gratitude towards mentor of ithaca in the odyssey whose name he has inserted in his poem as the companion of ulysses13 in return for the care taken of him when afflicted with blindness,novel
"i'm not familiar with the odyssey poem, but i do know that it is one of the most popular poems in the world.",chit-chat
he also testifies his gratitude to phemius who had given him both sustenance and instruction his celebrity continued to increase and many persons advised him to visit greece whither his reputation had now extended,novel
that's good to hear. i'm glad to hear that he's doing well.,chit-chat
having it is said made some additions to his poems calculated to please the vanity of the athenians of whose city he had hitherto made no mention14 he sent out for samos,novel
that's really interesting. i've never heard of samos before. what is it about?,chit-chat
here being recognized by a samian who had met with him in chios he was handsomely received and invited to join in celebrating the apaturian festival,novel
that's really cool. i've never been to an apaturian festival before.,chit-chat
he recited some verses which gave great satisfaction and by singing the eiresione at the new moon festivals he earned a subsistence visiting the houses of the rich with whose children he was very popular,novel
"wow, that's really cool. i've never heard of him before. what was his name?",chit-chat
in the spring he sailed for athens and arrived at the island of ios now ino where he fell extremely ill and died,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. it must have been very hard for him to go through that.,chit-chat
it is said that his death arose from vexation at not having been able to unravel an enigma proposed by some fishermens children,novel
that's so sad. i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he was able to unravel the enigma.,chit-chat
15 such is in brief the substance of the earliest life of homer we possess and so broad are the evidences of its historical worthlessness that it is scarcely necessary to point them out in detail,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. do you mean that the earliest life of homer we possess and so broad are the evidences of its historical worthlessness that it is scarcely necessary to point them out in detail?,chit-chat
let us now consider some of the opinions to which a persevering patient and learnedbut by no means consistentseries of investigations has led,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a fan of trump either.",chit-chat
in doing so i profess to bring forward statements not to vouch for their reasonableness or probability,novel
that's a good way to do it. it's good that you're able to do that.,chit-chat
homer appeared,novel
have you ever seen an episode of homer simpson? it's a show about homer simpson.,chit-chat

the majestic stream of his song blessing and fertilizing flows like the nile through many lands and nations and like the sources of the nile its fountains will ever remain concealed such are the words in which one of the most judicious german critics has eloquently described the uncertainty in which the whole of the homeric question is involved,novel

if we were in possession of all the historical testimonies we never could wholly explain the origin of the iliad and the odyssey for their origin in all essential points must have remained the secret of the poet16 from this criticism which shows as much insight into the depths of human nature as into the minute wiredrawings of scholastic investigation let us pass on to the main question at issue,novel
i'm not familiar with the poet16. what does it say about the odyssey?,chit-chat
was homer an individual,novel
"yes, he was an individual. he was the first person to be born in homer's hometown.",chit-chat

before however entering into particulars respecting the question of this unity of the homeric poems at least of the iliad i must express my sympathy with the sentiments expressed in the following remarks we can not but think the universal admiration of its unity by the better the poetic age of greece almost conclusive testimony to its original composition,novel
"i've never read the iliad, but i'm familiar with it. what's it about?",chit-chat
it was not till the age of the grammarians that its primitive integrity was called in question nor is it injustice to assert that the minute and analytical spirit of a grammarian is not the best qualification for the profound feeling the comprehensive conception of an harmonious whole,novel

longinus in an oft quoted passage merely expressed an opinion touching the comparative inferiority of the odyssey to the iliad21 and among a mass of ancient authors whose very names22 it would be tedious to detail no suspicion of the personal nonexistence of homer ever arose,novel

so far the voice of antiquity seems to be in favour of our early ideas on the subject let us now see what are the discoveries to which more modern investigations lay claim,novel
i'm not familiar with the voice of antiquity. what do you think is in favor of it?,chit-chat
at the end of the seventeenth century doubts had begun to awaken on the subject and we find bentley remarking that homer wrote a sequel of songs and rhapsodies to be sung by himself for small comings and good cheer at festivals and other days of merriment,novel
that's so cool! i've always wanted to go to a festival like that.,chit-chat
these loose songs were not collected together in the form of an epic poem till about peisistratus time about five hundred years after23 two french writershedelin and perraultavowed a similar scepticism on the subject but it is in the scienza nuova of battista vico that we first meet with the germ of the theory subsequently defended by wolf with so much learning and acuteness,novel
i've never heard of battista vico. what's the theory of the theory?,chit-chat
indeed it is with the wolfian theory that we have chiefly to deal and with the following bold hypothesis which we will detail in the words of grote24 half a century ago the acute and valuable prolegomena of f a wolf turning to account the venetian scholia which had then been recently published first opened philosophical discussion as to the history of the homeric text,novel
"i'm not familiar with the wolfian theory, but i do know that it's an interesting topic.",chit-chat
a considerable part of that dissertation though by no means the whole is employed in vindicating the position previously announced by bentley amongst others that the separate constituent portions of the iliad and odyssey had not been cemented together into any compact body and unchangeable order until the days of peisistratus in the sixth century before christ,novel
that's interesting. i didn't know that. do you have a source for that?,chit-chat
as a step towards that conclusion wolf maintained that no written copies of either poem could be shown to have existed during the earlier times to which their composition is referred and that without writing neither the perfect symmetry of so complicated a work could have been originally conceived by any poet nor if realized by him transmitted with assurance to posterity,novel
that's a great way to look at it. i've never thought of it that way before.,chit-chat
the absence of easy and convenient writing such as must be indispensably supposed for long manuscripts among the early greeks was thus one of the points in wolfs case against the primitive integrity of the iliad and odyssey,novel
i have never heard of wolfs case against the primitive integrity of the iliad and odyssey.,chit-chat
by nitzsch and other leading opponents of wolf the connection of the one with the other seems to have been accepted as he originally put it and it has been considered incumbent on those who defended the ancient aggregate character of the iliad and odyssey to maintain that they were written poems from the beginning,novel
"that's interesting, i didn't know that. do you have a favorite poem?",chit-chat
to me it appears that the architectonic functions ascribed by wolf to peisistratus and his associates in reference to the homeric poems are nowise admissible,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. do you mean that the homeric poems are no wise admissible?,chit-chat
but much would undoubtedly be gained towards that view of the question if it could be shown that in order to controvert it we were driven to the necessity of admitting long written poems in the ninth century before the christian æra,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure i've ever heard of the christian æra. what's his name?,chit-chat
few things in my opinion can be more improbable and mr payne knight opposed as he is to the wolfian hypothesis admits this no less than wolf himself,novel
i'm not familiar with payne knight. what does he have to do with wolfian hypothesis?,chit-chat
the traces of writing in greece even in the seventh century before the christian æra are exceedingly trifling,novel
"i'm not familiar with the æra, but i do know that the word "" æra "" was first recorded in the 10th century.",chit-chat
we have no remaining inscription earlier than the fortieth olympiad and the early inscriptions are rude and unskilfully executed nor can we even assure ourselves whether archilochus simonidês of amorgus kallinus tyrtæus xanthus and the other early elegiac and lyric poets committed their compositions to writing or at what time the practice of doing so became familiar,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i've never heard of the fortieth olympiad. what's it about?,chit-chat
the first positive ground which authorizes us to presume the existence of a manuscript of homer is in the famous ordinance of solôn with regard to the rhapsodies at the panathenæa but for what length of time previously manuscripts had existed we are unable to say,novel
"i have never heard of the panathenæa, but i do know that it is the largest city in the world.",chit-chat
those who maintain the homeric poems to have been written from the beginning rest their case not upon positive proofs nor yet upon the existing habits of society with regard to poetryfor they admit generally that the iliad and odyssey were not read but recited and heardbut upon the supposed necessity that there must have been manuscripts to ensure the preservation of the poemsthe unassisted memory of reciters being neither sufficient nor trustworthy,novel
i've never read the iliad or odyssey. what's it about?,chit-chat
but here we only escape a smaller difficulty by running into a greater for the existence of trained bards gifted with extraordinary memory25 is far less astonishing than that of long manuscripts in an age essentially nonreading and nonwriting and when even suitable instruments and materials for the process are not obvious,novel
that's a very good point. i'm not sure if i could do it.,chit-chat
moreover there is a strong positive reason for believing that the bard was under no necessity of refreshing his memory by consulting a manuscript for if such had been the fact blindness would have been a disqualification for the profession which we know that it was not as well from the example of demodokus in the odyssey as from that of the blind bard of chios in the hymn to the delian apollo whom thucydides as well as the general tenor of grecian legend identifies with homer himself,novel
i'm not familiar with the odyssey. what is it about it that you like?,chit-chat
the author of that hymn be he who he may could never have described a blind man as attaining the utmost perfection in his art if he had been conscious that the memory of the bard was only maintained by constant reference to the manuscript in his chest the loss of the digamma that _crux_ of critics that quicksand upon which even the acumen of bentley was shipwrecked seems to prove beyond a doubt that the pronunciation of the greek language had undergone a considerable change,novel

now it is certainly difficult to suppose that the homeric poems could have suffered by this change had written copies been preserved,novel
that's a very good point. it's hard to imagine what could have been.,chit-chat
if chaucers poetry for instance had not been written it could only have come down to us in a softened form more like the effeminate version of dryden than the rough quaint noble original,novel
i've never heard of chaucers poetry. what's it about? do you like it?,chit-chat
at what period continues grote these poems or indeed any other greek poems first began to be written must be matter of conjecture though there is ground for assurance that it was before the time of solôn,novel
"i'm not sure, but i do know that the first poems were written in the late 19th century.",chit-chat
if in the absence of evidence we may venture upon naming any more determinate period the question at once suggests itself what were the purposes which in that state of society a manuscript at its first commencement must have been intended to answer,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you referring to the question itself?,chit-chat
for whom was a written iliad necessary,novel
have you ever read the iliad? it's a collection of short stories written by george orwell.,chit-chat
not for the rhapsodes for with them it was not only planted in the memory but also interwoven with the feelings and conceived in conjunction with all those flexions and intonations of voice pauses and other oral artifices which were required for emphatic delivery and which the naked manuscript could never reproduce,novel
that's interesting. i didn't know that. do you have a source for that?,chit-chat
not for the general publicthey were accustomed to receive it with its rhapsodic delivery and with its accompaniments of a solemn and crowded festival,novel
"that's a good point, i didn't think of that. i'll have to think about that.",chit-chat
the only persons for whom the written iliad would be suitable would be a select few studious and curious men a class of readers capable of analyzing the complicated emotions which they had experienced as hearers in the crowd and who would on perusing the written words realize in their imaginations a sensible portion of the impression communicated by the reciter,novel
"i've never read the iliad, but i'm sure it's a great read.",chit-chat
incredible as the statement may seem in an age like the present there is in all early societies and there was in early greece a time when no such reading class existed,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you talking about the greek reading class?,chit-chat
if we could discover at what time such a class first began to be formed we should be able to make a guess at the time when the old epic poems were first committed to writing,novel
"that's a good point. i'm not sure when the first poems were written, but i know they were written in the late 19th century.",chit-chat
now the period which may with the greatest probability be fixed upon as having first witnessed the formation even of the narrowest reading class in greece is the middle of the seventh century before the christian æra bc,novel

such a change was important at a time when poetry was the only known mode of publication to use a modern phrase not altogether suitable yet the nearest approaching to the sense,novel
"that's true. poetry has changed so much over the years, it's hard to keep up.",chit-chat
it argued a new way of looking at the old epical treasures of the people as well as a thirst for new poetical effect and the men who stood forward in it may well be considered as desirous to study and competent to criticize from their own individual point of view the written words of the homeric rhapsodies just as we are told that kallinus both noticed and eulogized the thebaïs as the production of homer,novel
i'm not familiar with the homeric rhapsodies. what do you know about them?,chit-chat
there seems therefore ground for conjecturing that for the use of this newlyformed and important but very narrow class manuscripts of the homeric poems and other old epicsthe thebaïs and the cypria as well as the iliad and the odysseybegan to be compiled towards the middle of the seventh century bc,novel
i'm not familiar with the history of the odysseyrs. what is it about them that you find interesting?,chit-chat

a reading class when once formed would doubtless slowly increase and the number of manuscripts along with it so that before the time of solôn fifty years afterwards both readers and manuscripts though still comparatively few might have attained a certain recognized authority and formed a tribunal of reference against the carelessness of individual rhapsodes26 but even peisistratus has not been suffered to remain in possession of the credit and we can not help feeling the force of the following observations there are several incidental circumstances which in our opinion throw some suspicion over the whole history of the peisistratid compilation at least over the theory that the iliad was cast into its present stately and harmonious form by the directions of the athenian ruler,novel
"i'm not familiar with the iliad, but i do know that it's the oldest book in the bible.",chit-chat
if the great poets who flourished at the bright period of grecian song of which alas,novel
i've never heard of grecian song of which alas. what's it about?,chit-chat
we have inherited little more than the fame and the faint echo if stesichorus anacreon and simonidês were employed in the noble task of compiling the iliad and odyssey so much must have been done to arrange to connect to harmonize that it is almost incredible that stronger marks of athenian manufacture should not remain,novel
that's very interesting. i'm not familiar with the iliad. what's it about?,chit-chat
whatever occasional anomalies may be detected anomalies which no doubt arise out of our own ignorance of the language of the homeric age however the irregular use of the digamma may have perplexed our bentleys to whom the name of helen is said to have caused as much disquiet and distress as the fair one herself among the heroes of her age however mr knight may have failed in reducing the homeric language to its primitive form however finally the attic dialect may not have assumed all its more marked and distinguishing characteristicsstill it is difficult to suppose that the language particularly in the joinings and transitions and connecting parts should not more clearly betray the incongruity between the more ancient and modern forms of expression,novel
the attic dialect may not have assumed all its more marked and distinguishing characteristicsstill it is difficult to suppose that the language particularly in the joinings and transitions and connecting parts should not more clearly betray the incongruity between the more ancient and modern forms of expression,chit-chat
it is not quite in character with such a period to imitate an antique style in order to piece out an imperfect poem in the character of the original as sir walter scott has done in his continuation of sir tristram,novel
"i've never heard of sir tristram, but i'll look into it.",chit-chat
if however not even such faint and indistinct traces of athenian compilation are discoverable in the language of the poems the total absence of athenian national feeling is perhaps no less worthy of observation,novel
i'm not sure what you mean. are you saying that the lack of athenian national feeling is no less worthy of observation?,chit-chat
in later and it may fairly be suspected in earlier times the athenians were more than ordinarily jealous of the fame of their ancestors,novel
i don't think so. i think it's more likely that the athenians didn't believe in the existence of god.,chit-chat
but amid all the traditions of the glories of early greece embodied in the iliad the athenians play a most subordinate and insignificant part,novel
"i've never heard of the athenians, but i'm familiar with the iliad. do you know much about them?",chit-chat
even the few passages which relate to their ancestors mr knight suspects to be interpolations,novel
"i've never heard of mr knight, but i'm familiar with him. what's his name?",chit-chat
it is possible indeed that in its leading outline the iliad may be true to historic fact that in the great maritime expedition of western greece against the rival and halfkindred empire of the laomedontiadæ the chieftain of thessaly from his valour and the number of his forces may have been the most important ally of the peloponnesian sovereign the preeminent value of the ancient poetry on the trojan war may thus have forced the national feeling of the athenians to yield to their taste,novel
i'm not familiar with the peloponnesian sovereign. do you know much about them?,chit-chat
the songs which spoke of their own great ancestor were no doubt of far inferior sublimity and popularity or at first sight a theseid would have been much more likely to have emanated from an athenian synod of compilers of ancient song than an achilleid or an olysseid,novel
that's a very good point. i've never thought about it that way before.,chit-chat
could france have given birth to a tasso tancred would have been the hero of the jerusalem,novel
i'm not familiar with tasso tancred. what's it like to live there?,chit-chat
if however the homeric ballads as they are sometimes called which related the wrath of achilles with all its direful consequences were so far superior to the rest of the poetic cycle as to admit no rivalryit is still surprising that throughout the whole poem the callida junctura should never betray the workmanship of an athenian hand and that the national spirit of a race who have at a later period not inaptly been compared to our self admiring neighbours the french should submit with lofty self denial to the almost total exclusion of their own ancestorsor at least to the questionable dignity of only having produced a leader tolerably skilled in the military tactics of his age27 to return to the wolfian theory,novel
"i've never heard of the wolfian theory, but i'll look into it.",chit-chat
while it is to be confessed that wolfs objections to the primitive integrity of the iliad and odyssey have never been wholly got over we can not help discovering that they have failed to enlighten us as to any substantial point and that the difficulties with which the whole subject is beset are rather augmented than otherwise if we admit his hypothesis,novel
"i don't know much about odyssey, but i do know that she is one of the most influential writers of all time.",chit-chat
nor is lachmanns28 modification of his theory any better,novel
i'm not familiar with lachmann28. what's his theory about?,chit-chat
he divides the first twentytwo books of the iliad into sixteen different songs and treats as ridiculous the belief that their amalgamation into one regular poem belongs to a period earlier than the age of peisistratus,novel
"i've never read the iliad, but i know that it was written in the late 19th century.",chit-chat
this as grote observes explains the gaps and contradictions in the narrative but it explains nothing else moreover we find no contradictions warranting this belief and the socalled sixteen poets concur in getting rid of the following leading men in the first battle after the secession of achilles elphenor chief of the eubœans tlepolemus of the rhodians pandarus of the lycians odius of the halizonians pirous and acamas of the thracians,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by contradictions. are you referring to the lack of contradiction in the narrative?,chit-chat
none of these heroes again make their appearance and we can but agree with colonel mure that it seems strange that any number of independent poets should have so harmoniously dispensed with the services of all six in the sequel the discrepancy by which pylæmenes who is represented as dead in the fifth book weeps at his sons funeral in the thirteenth can only be regarded as the result of an interpolation,novel
pylæmenes was a great poet. he was an english poet and a poet.,chit-chat
grote although not very distinct in stating his own opinions on the subject has done much to clearly show the incongruity of the wolfian theory and of lachmanns modifications with the character of peisistratus,novel
"i've never heard of peisistratus, but i'm familiar with his work. have you read any of his work?",chit-chat
but he has also shown and we think with equal success that the two questions relative to the primitive unity of these poems or supposing that impossible the unison of these parts by peisistratus and not before his time are essentially distinct,novel
peisistratus is a great poet. he is one of the most influential writers of all time.,chit-chat
in short a man may believe the iliad to have been put together out of preexisting songs without recognising the age of peisistratus as the period of its first compilation the friends or literary _employês_ of peisistratus must have found an iliad that was already ancient and the silence of the alexandrine critics respecting the peisistratic recension goes far to prove that among the numerous manuscripts they examined this was either wanting or thought unworthy of attention,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of the iliad before. what's it about?,chit-chat
moreover he continues the whole tenor of the poems themselves confirms what is here remarked,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you talking about the poem or the poem itself?,chit-chat
there is nothing either in the iliad or odyssey which savours of modernism applying that term to the age of peisistratusnothing which brings to our view the alterations brought about by two centuries in the greek language the coined money the habits of writing and reading the despotisms and republican governments the close military array the improved construction of ships the amphiktyonic convocations the mutual frequentation of religious festivals the oriental and egyptian veins of religion c familiar to the latter epoch,novel
"i'm not sure what you mean by "" there is nothing either in the iliad or odyssey "".",chit-chat
these alterations onomakritus and the other literary friends of peisistratus could hardly have failed to notice even without design had they then for the first time undertaken the task of piecing together many self existent epics into one large aggregate,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i've never read any of those books. what's your favorite?",chit-chat
everything in the two great homeric poems both in substance and in language belongs to an age two or three centuries earlier than peisistratus,novel
i've never heard of the two great homeric poems. do you have a favorite?,chit-chat
indeed even the interpolations or those passages which on the best grounds are pronounced to be such betray no trace of the sixth century before christ and may well have been heard by archilochus and kallinusin some cases even by arktinus and hesiodas genuine homeric matter,novel
i'm not familiar with the archilochus or kallinusin. what do you know about them?,chit-chat
29 as far as the evidences on the case as well internal as external enable us to judge we seem warranted in believing that the iliad and odyssey were recited substantially as they now stand always allowing for partial divergences of text and interpolations in 776 bc our first trustworthy mark of grecian time and this ancient date let it be added as it is the bestauthenticated fact so it is also the most important attribute of the homeric poems considered in reference to grecian history for they thus afford us an insight into the antihistorical character of the greeks enabling us to trace the subsequent forward march of the nation and to seize instructive contrasts between their former and their later condition30 on the whole i am inclined to believe that the labours of peisistratus were wholly of an editorial character although i must confess that i can lay down nothing respecting the extent of his labours,novel
"i'm not familiar with peisistratus's work, but i do know that he is one of the most influential writers of all time.",chit-chat
at the same time so far from believing that the composition or primary arrangement of these poems in their present form was the work of peisistratus i am rather persuaded that the fine taste and elegant mind of that athenian31 would lead him to preserve an ancient and traditional order of the poems rather than to patch and reconstruct them according to a fanciful hypothesis,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of athenian31 before. what's his name?,chit-chat
i will not repeat the many discussions respecting whether the poems were written or not or whether the art of writing was known in the time of their reputed author,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. do you mean that the art of writing was known in the time of their reputed author?,chit-chat
suffice it to say that the more we read the less satisfied we are upon either subject,novel
that's a good way to look at it. do you have a favorite book you read?,chit-chat
i can not however help thinking that the story which attributes the preservation of these poems to lycurgus is little else than a version of the same story as that of peisistratus while its historical probability must be measured by that of many others relating to the spartan confucius,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you talking about the greek god of war?,chit-chat
i will conclude this sketch of the homeric theories with an attempt made by an ingenious friend to unite them into something like consistency,novel
that's a good way to look at it. do you think it's true?,chit-chat

he saw that these ballads might be made of great utility to his purpose of writing a poem on the social position of hellas and as a collection he published these lays connecting them by a tale of his own,novel
that's really interesting. i've never heard of him before. what's his name?,chit-chat
this poem now exists under the title of the odyssea the author however did not affix his own name to the poem which in fact was great part of it remodelled from the archaic dialect of crete in which tongue the ballads were found by him,novel
that's interesting. i'm not familiar with the odyssea. what's it about?,chit-chat
he therefore called it the poem of homeros or the collector but this is rather a proof of his modesty and talent than of his mere drudging arrangement of other peoples ideas for as grote has finely observed arguing for the unity of authorship a great poet might have recast preexisting separate songs into one comprehensive whole but no mere arrangers or compilers would be competent to do so while employed on the wild legend of odysseus he met with a ballad recording the quarrel of achilles and agamemnon,novel
i've never heard of odysseus. what's it like to be a legend?,chit-chat
his noble mind seized the hint that there presented itself and the achilleïs32 grew under his hand,novel
"wow, that's a big achillegger! what did you do with it?",chit-chat
unity of design however caused him to publish the poem under the same pseudonyme as his former work and the disjointed lays of the ancient bards were joined together like those relating to the cid into a chronicle history named the iliad,novel
that's interesting. i didn't know that. do you have a source for that?,chit-chat
melesigenes knew that the poem was destined to be a lasting one and so it has proved but first the poems were destined to undergo many vicissitudes and corruptions by the people who took to singing them in the streets assemblies and agoras,novel
melesigenes was a great poet. he was a poet who wrote poems in his spare time.,chit-chat
however solôn first and then peisistratus and afterwards aristoteles and others revised the poems and restored the works of melesigenes homeros to their original integrity in a great measure33 having thus given some general notion of the strange theories which have developed themselves respecting this most interesting subject i must still express my conviction as to the unity of the authorship of the homeric poems,novel
i have never heard of melesigenes homeros. what is that theory about?,chit-chat
to deny that many corruptions and interpolations disfigure them and that the intrusive hand of the poetasters may here and there have inflicted a wound more serious than the negligence of the copyist would be an absurd and captious assumption but it is to a higher criticism that we must appeal if we would either understand or enjoy these poems,novel
i'm not sure i understand what you're saying. what do you mean by this?,chit-chat
in maintaining the authenticity and personality of their one author be he homer or melesigenes _quocunque nomine vocari eum jus fasque sit_ i feel conscious that while the whole weight of historical evidence is against the hypothesis which would assign these great works to a plurality of authors the most powerful internal evidence and that which springs from the deepest and most immediate impulse of the soul also speaks eloquently to the contrary,novel
that's a very interesting way of looking at it. do you have a favorite author?,chit-chat
the minutiæ of verbal criticism i am far from seeking to despise,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what do you do for a living? do you have any hobbies?,chit-chat
indeed considering the character of some of my own books such an attempt would be gross inconsistency,novel
"do you have any of your own books? i've never read any of them, but i'd like to.",chit-chat
but while i appreciate its importance in a philological view i am inclined to set little store on its æsthetic value especially in poetry,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm not sure i could do that.,chit-chat
three parts of the emendations made upon poets are mere alterations some of which had they been suggested to the author by his mæcenas or africanus he would probably have adopted,novel
"i've never heard of africanus, but i do know that he was an english poet.",chit-chat
moreover those who are most exact in laying down rules of verbal criticism and interpretation are often least competent to carry out their own precepts,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you referring to someone who doesn't know what they're talking about?,chit-chat
grammarians are not poets by profession but may be so _per accidens_,novel
"grammarians are not poets by profession, may be so per accidensbe.",chit-chat
i do not at this moment remember two emendations on homer calculated to substantially improve the poetry of a passage although a mass of remarks from herodotus down to loewe have given us the history of a thousand minute points without which our greek knowledge would be gloomy and jejune,novel
i'm not familiar with gloomy and jejune. what does gloomy mean in greek?,chit-chat
but it is not on words only that grammarians mere grammarians will exercise their elaborate and often tiresome ingenuity,novel
i'm not sure what you mean. are you saying that grammarians don't have elaborate elaborate ingenuity?,chit-chat
binding down an heroic or dramatic poet to the block upon which they have previously dissected his words and sentences they proceed to use the axe and the pruning knife by wholesale and inconsistent in everything but their wish to make out a case of unlawful affiliation they cut out book after book passage after passage till the author is reduced to a collection of fragments or till those who fancied they possessed the works of some great man find that they have been put off with a vile counterfeit got up at second hand,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i've never heard of poetry like that before. what's it about?",chit-chat
if we compare the theories of knight wolf lachmann and others we shall feel better satisfied of the utter uncertainty of criticism than of the apocryphal position of homer,novel
i'm not familiar with knight wolf lachmann. what's his theories about?,chit-chat
one rejects what another considers the turningpoint of his theory,novel
one rejects what another considers the turningpoint of their theory... what theory is that?,chit-chat
one cuts a supposed knot by expunging what another would explain by omitting something else,novel
one cuts a supposed knot by expunging what another would explain by omitting something else!,chit-chat
nor is this morbid species of sagacity by any means to be looked upon as a literary novelty,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you saying that you don't like the book?,chit-chat
justus lipsius a scholar of no ordinary skill seems to revel in the imaginary discovery that the tragedies attributed to seneca are by _four_ different authors,novel
i'm not familiar with justus lipsius. what does he do for a living?,chit-chat
34 now i will venture to assert that these tragedies are so uniform not only in their borrowed phraseologya phraseology with which writers like boethius and saxo grammaticus were more charmed than ourselvesin their freedom from real poetry and last but not least in an ultrarefined and consistent abandonment of good taste that few writers of the present day would question the capabilities of the same gentleman be he seneca or not to produce not only these but a great many more equally bad,novel
i'm not sure what you're trying to say. are you saying that poetry isn't real?,chit-chat
with equal sagacity father hardouin astonished the world with the startling announcement that the æneid of virgil and the satires of horace were literary deceptions,novel
i'm not familiar with father hardouin. what does he do for a living?,chit-chat
now without wishing to say one word of disrespect against the industry and learningnay the refined acutenesswhich scholars like wolf have bestowed upon this subject i must express my fears that many of our modern homeric theories will become matter for the surprise and entertainment rather than the instruction of posterity,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a fan of the industry.",chit-chat
nor can i help thinking that the literary history of more recent times will account for many points of difficulty in the transmission of the iliad and odyssey to a period so remote from that of their first creation,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure i've ever read the iliad or odyssey.,chit-chat
i have already expressed my belief that the labours of peisistratus were of a purely editorial character and there seems no more reason why corrupt and imperfect editions of homer may not have been abroad in his day than that the poems of valerius flaccus and tibullus should have given so much trouble to poggio scaliger and others,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a fan of poggio scaliger.",chit-chat
but after all the main fault in all the homeric theories is that they demand too great a sacrifice of those feelings to which poetry most powerfully appeals and which are its most fitting judges,novel
i don't think i've ever heard of homeric theories. what's it about?,chit-chat
the ingenuity which has sought to rob us of the name and existence of homer does too much violence to that inward emotion which makes our whole soul yearn with love and admiration for the blind bard of chios,novel
"i'm not a fan of chios, but i've been a fan for a long time.",chit-chat
to believe the author of the iliad a mere compiler is to degrade the powers of human invention to elevate analytical judgment at the expense of the most ennobling impulses of the soul and to forget the ocean in the contemplation of a polypus,novel
"i'm not familiar with the iliad, but i do know that it was written by george orwell.",chit-chat
there is a catholicity so to speak in the very name of homer,novel
i've never heard of that. what's it about? i'm not familiar with it.,chit-chat
our faith in the author of the iliad may be a mistaken one but as yet nobody has taught us a better,novel
"i've never read the iliad, but i know it's a great book.",chit-chat
while however i look upon the belief in homer as one that has nature herself for its mainspring while i can join with old ennius in believing in homer as the ghost who like some patron saint hovers round the bed of the poet and even bestows rare gifts from that wealth of imagination which a host of imitators could not exhauststill i am far from wishing to deny that the author of these great poems found a rich fund of tradition a wellstocked mythical storehouse from whence he might derive both subject and embellishment,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of a storehouse before. what is it?,chit-chat
but it is one thing to _use_ existing romances in the embellishment of a poem another to patch up the poem itself from such materials,novel
that's a good point. i've never thought about it that way before. do you have a favorite poem?,chit-chat
what consistency of style and execution can be hoped for from such an attempt,novel
"i'm not sure, but i think it's going to be a lot of fun.",chit-chat
or rather what bad taste and tedium will not be the infallible result,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure if i've ever had a bad taste in my life.,chit-chat
a blending of popular legends and a free use of the songs of other bards are features perfectly consistent with poetical originality,novel
"i'm not familiar with the song, but i do know that it's based on a song of the same name.",chit-chat
in fact the most original writer is still drawing upon outward impressionsnay even his own thoughts are a kind of secondary agents which support and feed the impulses of imagination,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of him. what's his name?,chit-chat
but unless there be some grand pervading principlesome invisible yet most distinctly stamped archetypus of the great whole a poem like the iliad can never come to the birth,novel
i love the iliad. it's one of my favorite poems. what's your favorite poem?,chit-chat
traditions the most picturesque episodes the most pathetic local associations teeming with the thoughts of gods and great men may crowd in one mighty vision or reveal themselves in more substantial forms to the mind of the poet but except the power to create a grand whole to which these shall be but as details and embellishments be present we shall have nought but a scrapbook a parterre filled with flowers and weeds strangling each other in their wild redundancy we shall have a cento of rags and tatters which will require little acuteness to detect,novel
i've never seen a picturesque episode before. what's it about?,chit-chat
sensible as i am of the difficulty of disproving a negative and aware as i must be of the weighty grounds there are for opposing my belief it still seems to me that the homeric question is one that is reserved for a higher criticism than it has often obtained,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm not a fan of homeric questions.,chit-chat
we are not by nature intended to know all things still less to compass the powers by which the greatest blessings of life have been placed at our disposal,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm not sure i agree with that.,chit-chat
were faith no virtue then we might indeed wonder why god willed our ignorance on any matter,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure i've ever thought about it that way.,chit-chat
but we are too well taught the contrary lesson and it seems as though our faith should be especially tried touching the men and the events which have wrought most influence upon the condition of humanity,novel
"that's a good point. i'm not sure if i agree with that, but i do agree with you.",chit-chat
and there is a kind of sacredness attached to the memory of the great and the good which seems to bid us repulse the scepticism which would allegorize their existence into a pleasing apologue and measure the giants of intellect by an homeopathic dynameter,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of homeopathic dynameters before. what do they do?,chit-chat
long and habitual reading of homer appears to familiarize our thoughts even to his incongruities or rather if we read in a right spirit and with a heartfelt appreciation we are too much dazzled too deeply wrapped in admiration of the whole to dwell upon the minute spots which mere analysis can discover,novel
that's a great way to look at it. i've been reading a lot lately.,chit-chat
in reading an heroic poem we must transform ourselves into heroes of the time being we in imagination must fight over the same battles woo the same loves burn with the same sense of injury as an achilles or a hector,novel
that's a great way to look at it. i've never thought of it that way before.,chit-chat
and if we can but attain this degree of enthusiasm and less enthusiasm will scarcely suffice for the reading of homer we shall feel that the poems of homer are not only the work of one writer but of the greatest writer that ever touched the hearts of men by the power of song,novel
"i've never read homer, but i know it's one of the most popular books of all time.",chit-chat
and it was this supposed unity of authorship which gave these poems their powerful influence over the minds of the men of old,novel
that's really cool. i've never heard of authorship before. what's it about?,chit-chat
heeren who is evidently little disposed in favour of modern theories finely observes it was homer who formed the character of the greek nation,novel
heeren is one of my favorite writers. he's one of the most popular writers of all time.,chit-chat
no poet has ever as a poet exercised a similar influence over his countrymen,novel
i've never heard of a poet exercising a similar influence over his countrymen.,chit-chat
prophets lawgivers and sages have formed the character of other nations it was reserved to a poet to form that of the greeks,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of sage. is he a greek poet?,chit-chat
this is a feature in their character which was not wholly erased even in the period of their degeneracy,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a fan of degeneracy.",chit-chat
when lawgivers and sages appeared in greece the work of the poet had already been accomplished and they paid homage to his superior genius,novel
that's really cool. i've always wanted to go to greece. have you ever been?,chit-chat
he held up before his nation the mirror in which they were to behold the world of gods and heroes no less than of feeble mortals and to behold them reflected with purity and truth,novel
that's really interesting. i've never heard of him before. what's his name?,chit-chat
his poems are founded on the first feeling of human nature on the love of children wife and country on that passion which outweighs all others the love of glory,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. i didn't know that. do you have a favorite poet?",chit-chat
his songs were poured forth from a breast which sympathized with all the feelings of man and therefore they enter and will continue to enter every breast which cherishes the same sympathies,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. i didn't know that. do you have a favorite song by him?",chit-chat
if it is granted to his immortal spirit from another heaven than any of which he dreamed on earth to look down on his race to see the nations from the fields of asia to the forests of hercynia performing pilgrimages to the fountain which his magic wand caused to flow if it is permitted to him to view the vast assemblage of grand of elevated of glorious productions which had been called into being by means of his songs wherever his immortal spirit may reside this alone would suffice to complete his happiness35 can we contemplate that ancient monument on which the apotheosis of homer36 is depictured and not feel how much of pleasing association how much that appeals most forcibly and most distinctly to our minds is lost by the admittance of any theory but our old tradition,novel
i'm not sure what you're talking about. are you talking about the apotheosis of homer36?,chit-chat
the more we read and the more we thinkthink as becomes the readers of homerthe more rooted becomes the conviction that the father of poetry gave us this rich inheritance whole and entire,novel
that's a great way to look at it. it's hard to believe that poetry has been around for so long.,chit-chat
whatever were the means of its preservation let us rather be thankful for the treasury of taste and eloquence thus laid open to our use than seek to make it a mere centre around which to drive a series of theories whose wildness is only equalled by their inconsistency with each other,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i think it's important to be grateful for what we have.,chit-chat
as the hymns and some other poems usually ascribed to homer are not included in popes translation i will content myself with a brief account of the battle of the frogs and mice from the pen of a writer who has done it full justice37 this poem says coleridge is a short mockheroic of ancient date,novel
that's interesting. i'm not familiar with the battle of the frogs and mice.,chit-chat
the text varies in different editions and is obviously disturbed and corrupt to a great degree it is commonly said to have been a juvenile essay of homers genius others have attributed it to the same pigrees mentioned above and whose reputation for humour seems to have invited the appropriation of any piece of ancient wit the author of which was uncertain so little did the greeks before the age of the ptolemies know or care about that department of criticism employed in determining the genuineness of ancient writings,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of that before. do you have a source for that?,chit-chat
as to this little poem being a youthful profusion of homer it seems sufficient to say that from the beginning to the end it is a plain and palpable parody not only of the general spirit but of the numerous passages of the iliad itself and even if no such intention to parody were discernible in it the objection would still remain that to suppose a work of mere burlesque to be the primary effort of poetry in a simple age seems to reverse that order in the development of national taste which the history of every other people in europe and of many in asia has almost ascertained to be a law of the human mind it is in a state of society much more refined and permanent than that described in the iliad that any popularity would attend such a ridicule of war and the gods as is contained in this poem and the fact of there having existed three other poems of the same kind attributed for aught we can see with as much reason to homer is a strong inducement to believe that none of them were of the homeric age,novel
"i'm not sure what you're trying to say, but i don't understand.",chit-chat

5 58 was the material employed by the asiatic greeks for that purpose that this poem was another offspring of attic ingenuity and generally that the familiar mention of the cock v 191 is a strong argument against so ancient a date for its composition having thus given a brief account of the poems comprised in popes design i will now proceed to make a few remarks on his translation and on my own purpose in the present edition,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i've never heard of the asiatic greeks before.",chit-chat
pope was not a grecian,novel
"i'm not sure what that means, but i know that pope francis was not a grecian.",chit-chat
his whole education had been irregular and his earliest acquaintance with the poet was through the version of ogilby,novel
ogilby was a great poet. he was an english poet and one of the most influential writers in the history of the english language.,chit-chat
it is not too much to say that his whole work bears the impress of a disposition to be satisfied with the general sense rather than to dive deeply into the minute and delicate features of language,novel
that's a good point. i think it's important to be satisfied with the general sense rather than to dive deeply into the minute and delicate features of language.,chit-chat
hence his whole work is to be looked upon rather as an elegant paraphrase than a translation,novel
that's what i was thinking. it's not like he's doing it for a living.,chit-chat
there are to be sure certain conventional anecdotes which prove that pope consulted various friends whose classical attainments were sounder than his own during the undertaking but it is probable that these examinations were the result rather of the contradictory versions already existing than of a desire to make a perfect transcript of the original,novel
that's a very interesting theory. do you have a favorite anecdotes to share?,chit-chat
and in those days what is called literal translation was less cultivated than at present,novel
that's a good point. it's hard to find a good translation these days.,chit-chat
if something like the general sense could be decorated with the easy gracefulness of a practised poet if the charms of metrical cadence and a pleasing fluency could be made consistent with a fair interpretation of the poets meaning his _words_ were less jealously sought for and those who could read so good a poem as popes iliad had fair reason to be satisfied,novel
"i'm not familiar with popes iliad, but i do know that he was an english poet.",chit-chat
it would be absurd therefore to test popes translation by our own advancing knowledge of the original text,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure i'd be able to do that.,chit-chat
we must be content to look at it as a most delightful work in itselfa work which is as much a part of english literature as homer himself is of greek,novel
i've never heard of itselfa. i'll have to check it out.,chit-chat
we must not be torn from our kindly associations with the old iliad that once was our most cherished companion or our most lookedfor prize merely because buttmann loewe and liddell have made us so much more accurate as to ἀμφικύπελλον being an adjective and not a substantive,novel
i've never heard of buttmann loewe or liddell. what's their name?,chit-chat
far be it from us to defend the faults of pope especially when we think of chapmans fine bold rough old englishfar be it from us to hold up his translation as what a translation of homer _might_ be,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm not a fan of the pope.,chit-chat
but we can still dismiss popes iliad to the hands of our readers with the consciousness that they must have read a very great number of books before they have read its fellow,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure i've read any of his books.,chit-chat
as to the notes accompanying the present volume they are drawn up without pretension and mainly with the view of helping the general reader,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm not sure i've ever read a book like that before.,chit-chat
having some little time since translated all the works of homer for another publisher i might have brought a large amount of accumulated matter sometimes of a critical character to bear upon the text,novel
"that's pretty cool. i've never read homer, but i'd love to.",chit-chat
but popes version was no field for such a display and my purpose was to touch briefly on antiquarian or mythological allusions to notice occasionally _some_ departures from the original and to give a few parallel passages from our english homer milton,novel
that's interesting. i'm not familiar with homer milton. what's his name?,chit-chat
in the latter task i can not pretend to novelty but i trust that my other annotations while utterly disclaiming high scholastic views will be found to convey as much as is wanted at least as far as the necessary limits of these volumes could be expected to admit,novel
that's a good way to look at it. what annotations are you referring to?,chit-chat
to write a commentary on homer is not my present aim but if i have made popes translation a little more entertaining and instructive to a mass of miscellaneous readers i shall consider my wishes satisfactorily accomplished,novel
that's a great attitude to have. i'm sure you'll do great.,chit-chat

the praise of judgment virgil has justly contested with him and others may have their pretensions as to particular excellences but his invention remains yet unrivalled,novel
i'm not familiar with judgment virgil. what does he do that you don't know about him?,chit-chat
nor is it a wonder if he has ever been acknowledged the greatest of poets who most excelled in that which is the very foundation of poetry,novel
"i'm not sure if he has, but i do know that he was an english poet.",chit-chat
it is the invention that in different degrees distinguishes all great geniuses the utmost stretch of human study learning and industry which masters everything besides can never attain to this,novel
that's a great way to look at it. i'm not sure i've ever thought about it that way before.,chit-chat
it furnishes art with all her materials and without it judgment itself can at best but steal wisely for art is only like a prudent steward that lives on managing the riches of nature,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a prudent steward.",chit-chat
whatever praises may be given to works of judgment there is not even a single beauty in them to which the invention must not contribute as in the most regular gardens art can only reduce beauties of nature to more regularity and such a figure which the common eye may better take in and is therefore more entertained with,novel
that's a very good point. i've never thought about it that way before.,chit-chat
and perhaps the reason why common critics are inclined to prefer a judicious and methodical genius to a great and fruitful one is because they find it easier for themselves to pursue their observations through a uniform and bounded walk of art than to comprehend the vast and various extent of nature,novel
i don't think so. i think it's just a matter of personal preference.,chit-chat
our authors work is a wild paradise where if we can not see all the beauties so distinctly as in an ordered garden it is only because the number of them is infinitely greater,novel
that's a great way to look at it. what kind of work do you do?,chit-chat
it is like a copious nursery which contains the seeds and first productions of every kind out of which those who followed him have but selected some particular plants each according to his fancy to cultivate and beautify,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of a copious nursery before. what is it?,chit-chat
if some things are too luxuriant it is owing to the richness of the soil and if others are not arrived to perfection or maturity it is only because they are overrun and oppressed by those of a stronger nature,novel
that's a good way of looking at it. i think you're right about that.,chit-chat
it is to the strength of this amazing invention we are to attribute that unequalled fire and rapture which is so forcible in homer that no man of a true poetical spirit is master of himself while he reads him,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by unequalled fire and rapture. what do you mean?,chit-chat
what he writes is of the most animated nature imaginable every thing moves every thing lives and is put in action,novel
that's so true. it's hard to believe that we've been living this way for so long.,chit-chat
if a council be called or a battle fought you are not coldly informed of what was said or done as from a third person the reader is hurried out of himself by the force of the poets imagination and turns in one place to a hearer in another to a spectator,novel

they pour along like a fire that sweeps the whole earth before it it is however remarkable that his fancy which is everywhere vigorous is not discovered immediately at the beginning of his poem in its fullest splendour it grows in the progress both upon himself and others and becomes on fire like a chariotwheel by its own rapidity,novel

nay where this appears though attended with absurdities it brightens all the rubbish about it till we see nothing but its own splendour,novel
i don't think i've ever been to a concert with absurdities.,chit-chat
this fire is discerned in virgil but discerned as through a glass reflected from homer more shining than fierce but everywhere equal and constant in lucan and statius it bursts out in sudden short and interrupted flashes in milton it glows like a furnace kept up to an uncommon ardour by the force of art in shakspeare it strikes before we are aware like an accidental fire from heaven but in homer and in him only it burns everywhere clearly and everywhere irresistibly,novel
"wow, that's intense. i'm sorry to hear that. what happened to homer?",chit-chat
i shall here endeavour to show how this vast invention exerts itself in a manner superior to that of any poet through all the main constituent parts of his work as it is the great and peculiar characteristic which distinguishes him from all other authors,novel
i'm not sure what you're trying to say. are you saying you don't like his work?,chit-chat

it seemed not enough to have taken in the whole circle of arts and the whole compass of nature to supply his maxims and reflections all the inward passions and affections of mankind to furnish his characters and all the outward forms and images of things for his descriptions but wanting yet an ampler sphere to expatiate in he opened a new and boundless walk for his imagination and created a world for himself in the invention of fable,novel
i love fable! it's one of my favorite games of all time. what's your favorite fable game?,chit-chat
that which aristotle calls the soul of poetry was first breathed into it by homer,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard that before. do you have a source for that?,chit-chat
i shall begin with considering him in his part as it is naturally the first and i speak of it both as it means the design of a poem and as it is taken for fiction,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm not sure i've ever thought about it that way.,chit-chat
fable may be divided into the probable the allegorical and the marvellous,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'll have to think about that.,chit-chat
the probable fable is the recital of such actions as though they did not happen yet might in the common course of nature or of such as though they did became fables by the additional episodes and manner of telling them,novel
that's a good way to look at it. do you think it's true?,chit-chat

virgil for want of so warm a genius aided himself by taking in a more extensive subject as well as a greater length of time and contracting the design of both homers poems into one which is yet but a fourth part as large as his,novel
i've never heard of virgil for want of so warm a genius. what is it about?,chit-chat
the other epic poets have used the same practice but generally carried it so far as to superinduce a multiplicity of fables destroy the unity of action and lose their readers in an unreasonable length of time,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of that before. what's it about?,chit-chat
nor is it only in the main design that they have been unable to add to his invention but they have followed him in every episode and part of story,novel
"i don't know if they follow him in every episode, but i do know that he is the main character in the show.",chit-chat
if he has given a regular catalogue of an army they all draw up their forces in the same order,novel
i don't think he has given a regular catalog of an army they all draw up their forces in the same order.,chit-chat
if he has funeral games for patroclus virgil has the same for anchises and statius rather than omit them destroys the unity of his actions for those of archemorus,novel
that's a good idea. i'm going to have to ask him to do that.,chit-chat
if ulysses visit the shades the æneas of virgil and scipio of silius are sent after him,novel
that's a good idea. i'm sure ulysses would love to see them.,chit-chat
if he be detained from his return by the allurements of calypso so is æneas by dido and rinaldo by armida,novel
"i don't know much about æneas, but i do know that she is an american singer.",chit-chat
if achilles be absent from the army on the score of a quarrel through half the poem rinaldo must absent himself just as long on the like account,novel
"rinaldo is the best player in the world, he should be on the like account.",chit-chat
if he gives his hero a suit of celestial armour virgil and tasso make the same present to theirs,novel
that's a good idea. i'll have to think about that. thanks for the idea!,chit-chat
virgil has not only observed this close imitation of homer but where he had not led the way supplied the want from other greek authors,novel
virgil has not only observed a close imitation of homer but where he had not led the way supplied the way from other greek authors,chit-chat
thus the story of sinon and the taking of troy was copied says macrobius almost word for word from pisander as the loves of dido and æneas are taken from those of medea and jason in apollonius and several others in the same manner,novel
that's interesting. i didn't know that. do you have a source for that?,chit-chat
to proceed to the allegorical fableif we reflect upon those innumerable knowledges those secrets of nature and physical philosophy which homer is generally supposed to have wrapped up in his allegories what a new and ample scene of wonder may this consideration afford us,novel
i'm not familiar with homer. what's his allegorical fableif?,chit-chat
how fertile will that imagination appear which was able to clothe all the properties of elements the qualifications of the mind the virtues and vices in forms and persons and to introduce them into actions agreeable to the nature of the things they shadowed,novel
"i'm not sure i understand what you're saying. what do you mean by "" how fertile will that imagination appear which was able to clothe all the properties of elements the mind the virtues and vices in forms and persons and to introduce them into actions agreeable to the nature of things they shadowed ""?",chit-chat
this is a field in which no succeeding poets could dispute with homer and whatever commendations have been allowed them on this head are by no means for their invention in having enlarged his circle but for their judgment in having contracted it,novel
that's a very interesting way of looking at it. do you have a favorite poet?,chit-chat
for when the mode of learning changed in the following ages and science was delivered in a plainer manner it then became as reasonable in the more modern poets to lay it aside as it was in homer to make use of it,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i think it's interesting that we have such a long history of learning.,chit-chat
and perhaps it was no unhappy circumstance for virgil that there was not in his time that demand upon him of so great an invention as might be capable of furnishing all those allegorical parts of a poem,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure i've ever thought about it that way before.,chit-chat
the marvellous fable includes whatever is supernatural and especially the machines of the gods,novel
i love the marvellous fable! it's my favorite book of all time.,chit-chat
if homer was not the first who introduced the deities as herodotus imagines into the religion of greece he seems the first who brought them into a system of machinery for poetry and such a one as makes its greatest importance and dignity for we find those authors who have been offended at the literal notion of the gods constantly laying their accusation against homer as the chief support of it,novel
"i'm not familiar with homer, but i do know that he was a greek poet.",chit-chat
but whatever cause there might be to blame his machines in a philosophical or religious view they are so perfect in the poetic that mankind have been ever since contented to follow them none have been able to enlarge the sphere of poetry beyond the limits he has set every attempt of this nature has proved unsuccessful and after all the various changes of times and religions his gods continue to this day the gods of poetry,novel
i'm not sure if you're being facetious or if you really believe that.,chit-chat
we come now to the characters of his persons and here we shall find no author has ever drawn so many with so visible and surprising a variety or given us such lively and affecting impressions of them,novel
that's a great way to look at it. i think it's amazing that he's still alive.,chit-chat
every one has something so singularly his own that no painter could have distinguished them more by their features than the poet has by their manners,novel
that's a great way to put it. do you have a favorite painter or poet?,chit-chat
nothing can be more exact than the distinctions he has observed in the different degrees of virtues and vices,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. what distinctions are you referring to?,chit-chat
the single quality of courage is wonderfully diversified in the several characters of the iliad,novel
"i've never read the iliad, but i'm sure it's interesting. what's your favorite character?",chit-chat
that of achilles is furious and intractable that of diomede forward yet listening to advice and subject to command that of ajax is heavy and selfconfiding of hector active and vigilant the courage of agamemnon is inspirited by love of empire and ambition that of menelaus mixed with softness and tenderness for his people we find in idomeneus a plain direct soldier in sarpedon a gallant and generous one,novel
i've never heard of sarpedon a gallant and generous one. what is it about?,chit-chat
nor is this judicious and astonishing diversity to be found only in the principal quality which constitutes the main of each character but even in the under parts of it to which he takes care to give a tincture of that principal one,novel
i'm not sure what you're trying to say. are you saying you don't like the show?,chit-chat
for example the main characters of ulysses and nestor consist in wisdom and they are distinct in this that the wisdom of one is artificial and various of the other natural open and regular,novel
that's interesting. i didn't know that ulysses and nestor were related.,chit-chat
but they have besides characters of courage and this quality also takes a different turn in each from the difference of his prudence for one in the war depends still upon caution the other upon experience,novel
that's a good point. i guess it's just a matter of personal preference.,chit-chat
it would be endless to produce instances of these kinds,novel
yes it would. i would love to see what they would come up with. it would be amazing.,chit-chat
the characters of virgil are far from striking us in this open manner they lie in a great degree hidden and undistinguished and where they are marked most evidently affect us not in proportion to those of homer,novel
i don't think i've ever heard of virgil. what's it about?,chit-chat
his characters of valour are much alike even that of turnus seems no way peculiar but as it is in a superior degree and we see nothing that differences the courage of mnestheus from that of sergestus cloanthus or the rest,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a fan of mnestheus.",chit-chat
in like manner it may be remarked of statiuss heroes that an air of impetuosity runs through them all the same horrid and savage courage appears in his capaneus tydeus hippomedon c they have a parity of character which makes them seem brothers of one family,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun! i'll have to check it out. what's your favorite hero?,chit-chat
i believe when the reader is led into this tract of reflection if he will pursue it through the epic and tragic writers he will be convinced how infinitely superior in this point the invention of homer was to that of all others,novel
i don't think so. i think he will find a way to live with it.,chit-chat
the speeches are to be considered as they flow from the characters being perfect or defective as they agree or disagree with the manners of those who utter them,novel
that makes a lot of sense. i didn't know that. do you have a favorite character?,chit-chat
as there is more variety of characters in the iliad so there is of speeches than in any other poem,novel
that's interesting. i've never read the iliad. what's it about?,chit-chat
everything in it has manner as aristotle expresses it that is everything is acted or spoken,novel
that's a good way to look at it. it's interesting to think about.,chit-chat
it is hardly credible in a work of such length how small a number of lines are employed in narration,novel
i don't think i've ever heard of narration before. what's it like?,chit-chat
in virgil the dramatic part is less in proportion to the narrative and the speeches often consist of general reflections or thoughts which might be equally just in any persons mouth upon the same occasion,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure i've ever thought about it that way before.,chit-chat
as many of his persons have no apparent characters so many of his speeches escape being applied and judged by the rule of propriety,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a fan of his speeches.",chit-chat
we oftener think of the author himself when we read virgil than when we are engaged in homer all which are the effects of a colder invention that interests us less in the action described,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm not sure i've ever thought about it that way.,chit-chat
homer makes us hearers and virgil leaves us readers,novel
"homer makes us hearks, virgil leaves us readers. that's a great way to put it.",chit-chat
if in the next place we take a view of the sentiments the same presiding faculty is eminent in the sublimity and spirit of his thoughts,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm not sure i could do that.,chit-chat
longinus has given his opinion that it was in this part homer principally excelled,novel
i'm not familiar with longinus. what's his opinion on it? do you have a favorite team?,chit-chat
what were alone sufficient to prove the grandeur and excellence of his sentiments in general is that they have so remarkable a parity with those of the scripture,novel
what do you mean by that? i'm not sure what you're talking about.,chit-chat
duport in his gnomologia homerica has collected innumerable instances of this sort,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's able to get over it.,chit-chat
and it is with justice an excellent modern writer allows that if virgil has not so many thoughts that are low and vulgar he has not so many that are sublime and noble and that the roman author seldom rises into very astonishing sentiments where he is not fired by the iliad,novel
"i don't know much about virgil, but i do know that he is one of the most influential writers in the world.",chit-chat
if we observe his descriptions images and similes we shall find the invention still predominant,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you talking about the invention of the iphone?,chit-chat
to what else can we ascribe that vast comprehension of images of every sort where we see each circumstance of art and individual of nature summoned together by the extent and fecundity of his imagination to which all things in their various views presented themselves in an instant and had their impressions taken off to perfection at a heat,novel
that's an interesting way to look at it. do you have a favorite artist or artist?,chit-chat
nay he not only gives us the full prospects of things but several unexpected peculiarities and side views unobserved by any painter but homer,novel
"i'm not a fan of homer, but i can see why you'd feel that way.",chit-chat
nothing is so surprising as the descriptions of his battles which take up no less than half the iliad and are supplied with so vast a variety of incidents that no one bears a likeness to another such different kinds of deaths that no two heroes are wounded in the same manner and such a profusion of noble ideas that every battle rises above the last in greatness horror and confusion,novel
that's really interesting. i've never read the iliad. what's it about?,chit-chat
it is certain there is not near that number of images and descriptions in any epic poet though every one has assisted himself with a great quantity out of him and it is evident of virgil especially that he has scarce any comparisons which are not drawn from his master,novel
i think you're right. it's a shame that he's such a great poet.,chit-chat
if we descend from hence to the expression we see the bright imagination of homer shining out in the most enlivened forms of it,novel
that's a great way to look at it. i'm not sure what you mean by that.,chit-chat
we acknowledge him the father of poetical diction the first who taught that language of the gods to men,novel
that's really cool. i've never heard of poetical diction. what does it mean?,chit-chat
his expression is like the colouring of some great masters which discovers itself to be laid on boldly and executed with rapidity,novel
that's a great way to look at it. i think it's so cute.,chit-chat
it is indeed the strongest and most glowing imaginable and touched with the greatest spirit,novel
i'm glad you think so. it's hard for me to think about it.,chit-chat
aristotle had reason to say he was the only poet who had found out living words there are in him more daring figures and metaphors than in any good author whatever,novel
aristotle was a great poet. he was one of the most influential and influential philosophers of the 20th century.,chit-chat
an arrow is impatient to be on the wing a weapon thirsts to drink the blood of an enemy and the like yet his expression is never too big for the sense but justly great in proportion to it,novel
i've never heard of an arrow being impatient to be on the wing a weapon thirsts to drink the blood of an enemy and the like yet his expression is never too big for the sense but justly great in proportion to it,chit-chat
it is the sentiment that swells and fills out the diction which rises with it and forms itself about it for in the same degree that a thought is warmer an expression will be brighter as that is more strong this will become more perspicuous like glass in the furnace which grows to a greater magnitude and refines to a greater clearness only as the breath within is more powerful and the heat more intense,novel
it is the sentiment that swells and fills out the diction and forms itself about it for in the same degree that a thought is warmer an expression will be brighter as that is more strong this will become more persplike glass in the furnace which grows to a greater magnitude and refines to a larger clearness only as the breath within is more powerful and heat,chit-chat
to throw his language more out of prose homer seems to have affected the compound epithets,novel
i don't know much about compound epithets. what's it about?,chit-chat
this was a sort of composition peculiarly proper to poetry not only as it heightened the diction but as it assisted and filled the numbers with greater sound and pomp and likewise conduced in some measure to thicken the images,novel
that's really cool. i've never heard of poetry like that before. are you a poet?,chit-chat
on this last consideration i can not but attribute these also to the fruitfulness of his invention since as he has managed them they are a sort of supernumerary pictures of the persons or things to which they were joined,novel
that's a great way to look at it. i've never heard of him before.,chit-chat
we see the motion of hectors plumes in the epithet κορυθαίολος the landscape of mount neritus in that of εἰνοσίφυλλος and so of others which particular images could not have been insisted upon so long as to express them in a description though but of a single line without diverting the reader too much from the principal action or figure,novel
"i've never been to mount neritus, but i'd love to see it.",chit-chat
as a metaphor is a short simile one of these epithets is a short description,novel
i've never heard of a simile before. do you have a favorite simile?,chit-chat
lastly if we consider his versification we shall be sensible what a share of praise is due to his invention in that also,novel
i'm not familiar with lastly. what does he have to do with versification?,chit-chat
he was not satisfied with his language as he found it settled in any one part of greece but searched through its different dialects with this particular view to beautify and perfect his numbers he considered these as they had a greater mixture of vowels or consonants and accordingly employed them as the verse required either a greater smoothness or strength,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i'm not familiar with greek. what dialect did he speak?",chit-chat
what he most affected was the ionic which has a peculiar sweetness from its never using contractions and from its custom of resolving the diphthongs into two syllables so as to make the words open themselves with a more spreading and sonorous fluency,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of an ionic before. what is it?,chit-chat
with this he mingled the attic contractions the broader doric and the feebler æolic which often rejects its aspirate or takes off its accent and completed this variety by altering some letters with the licence of poetry,novel
"wow, that's impressive. i've never heard of a feebler æolic before.",chit-chat
thus his measures instead of being fetters to his sense were always in readiness to run along with the warmth of his rapture and even to give a further representation of his notions in the correspondence of their sounds to what they signified,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm not sure i could do that.,chit-chat
out of all these he has derived that harmony which makes us confess he had not only the richest head but the finest ear in the world,novel
that's a great way to look at it. i'm glad to hear that.,chit-chat
this is so great a truth that whoever will but consult the tune of his verses even without understanding them with the same sort of diligence as we daily see practised in the case of italian operas will find more sweetness variety and majesty of sound than in any other language of poetry,novel
i agree. it's amazing to think that poetry can be written in so many different languages.,chit-chat
the beauty of his numbers is allowed by the critics to be copied but faintly by virgil himself though they are so just as to ascribe it to the nature of the latin tongue indeed the greek has some advantages both from the natural sound of its words and the turn and cadence of its verse which agree with the genius of no other language,novel
"i don't know much about greek, but i do know that it is one of the most popular languages in the world.",chit-chat
virgil was very sensible of this and used the utmost diligence in working up a more intractable language to whatsoever graces it was capable of and in particular never failed to bring the sound of his line to a beautiful agreement with its sense,novel
that's good to hear. i'm glad you're able to understand what he's saying.,chit-chat
if the grecian poet has not been so frequently celebrated on this account as the roman the only reason is that fewer critics have understood one language than the other,novel
"i'm not familiar with the grecian poet, but i do know that he was an english poet.",chit-chat
dionysius of halicarnassus has pointed out many of our authors beauties in this kind in his treatise of the composition of words,novel
i'm not familiar with halicarnassus. what does he say about beauty?,chit-chat
it suffices at present to observe of his numbers that they flow with so much ease as to make one imagine homer had no other care than to transcribe as fast as the muses dictated and at the same time with so much force and inspiriting vigour that they awaken and raise us like the sound of a trumpet,novel
that's a great way to look at it. i'm glad you enjoyed it.,chit-chat
they roll along as a plentiful river always in motion and always full while we are borne away by a tide of verse the most rapid and yet the most smooth imaginable,novel
that's so true. it's amazing to think about how much we've changed over the years.,chit-chat
thus on whatever side we contemplate homer what principally strikes us is his invention,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you referring to homer's invention?,chit-chat
it is that which forms the character of each part of his work and accordingly we find it to have made his fable more extensive and copious than any other his manners more lively and strongly marked his speeches more affecting and transported his sentiments more warm and sublime his images and descriptions more full and animated his expression more raised and daring and his numbers more rapid and various,novel
that's a very interesting way to look at it. i'm not sure i agree.,chit-chat
i hope in what has been said of virgil with regard to any of these heads i have no way derogated from his character,novel
"i don't know much about virgil, but i'm sure he's a good guy.",chit-chat
nothing is more absurd or endless than the common method of comparing eminent writers by an opposition of particular passages in them and forming a judgment from thence of their merit upon the whole,novel
i've never heard of this before. what's the name of the book you're talking about?,chit-chat
we ought to have a certain knowledge of the principal character and distinguishing excellence of each it is in that we are to consider him and in proportion to his degree in that we are to admire him,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm not sure i've ever thought about it that way.,chit-chat
no author or man ever excelled all the world in more than one faculty and as homer has done this in invention virgil has in judgment,novel
"i'm not sure what invention virgil has in judgment has to do with anything, but okay.",chit-chat
not that we are to think that homer wanted judgment because virgil had it in a more eminent degree or that virgil wanted invention because homer possessed a larger share of it each of these great authors had more of both than perhaps any man besides and are only said to have less in comparison with one another,novel
that makes a lot of sense. i'm not sure i've ever heard of virgil having it in a more eminent degree.,chit-chat
homer was the greater genius virgil the better artist,novel
homer was the greatest artist of all time. he was the best artist in the history of art.,chit-chat
in one we most admire the man in the other the work,novel
that's a good way to look at it. it's nice to have someone you admire in your life.,chit-chat
homer hurries and transports us with a commanding impetuosity virgil leads us with an attractive majesty homer scatters with a generous profusion virgil bestows with a careful magnificence homer like the nile pours out his riches with a boundless overflow virgil like a river in its banks with a gentle and constant stream,novel
i love homer hurries and transports us with a commanding impetuosity virgil leads us with an attractive majesty homer scatters with a generous profusion virgil bestows with a careful magnificence homer like the nile pours out their riches with a boundless overflow virgil like a river in its banks with a gentle and constant stream,chit-chat
when we behold their battles methinks the two poets resemble the heroes they celebrate,novel
that's a great way to look at it. do you have a favorite poet or poet?,chit-chat
homer boundless and resistless as achilles bears all before him and shines more and more as the tumult increases virgil calmly daring like æneas appears undisturbed in the midst of the action disposes all about him and conquers with tranquillity,novel
"homer boundless and resistless as achilles bears all before him and shines more, the tumult increases virgil calmly daring like æneas appears undisturbed in the action disposes all about him and conquers with tranquillity",chit-chat
and when we look upon their machines homer seems like his own jupiter in his terrors shaking olympus scattering the lightnings and firing the heavens virgil like the same power in his benevolence counselling with the gods laying plans for empires and regularly ordering his whole creation,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i've never heard of homer before. what's his name?",chit-chat
but after all it is with great parts as with great virtues they naturally border on some imperfection and it is often hard to distinguish exactly where the virtue ends or the fault begins,novel
that's true. it's hard to tell exactly where the virtue ends or the fault starts.,chit-chat
as prudence may sometimes sink to suspicion so may a great judgment decline to coldness and as magnanimity may run up to profusion or extravagance so may a great invention to redundancy or wildness,novel
"i'm not sure i understand what you're saying. are you saying that as prudence may sometimes sink to suspicion, and as magnanimity may run up to profusion or extravagance so may a great invention of redundancy or wildness?",chit-chat
if we look upon homer in this view we shall perceive the chief objections against him to proceed from so noble a cause as the excess of this faculty,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm sure he'll agree with you.,chit-chat
among these we may reckon some of his marvellous fictions upon which so much criticism has been spent as surpassing all the bounds of probability,novel
i don't think so. i think it's more likely that he just doesn't care.,chit-chat
perhaps it may be with great and superior souls as with gigantic bodies which exerting themselves with unusual strength exceed what is commonly thought the due proportion of parts to become miracles in the whole and like the old heroes of that make commit something near extravagance amidst a series of glorious and inimitable performances,novel
that's a very interesting theory. i'll have to look into it more. do you have a favorite hero?,chit-chat
thus homer has his speaking horses and virgil his myrtles distilling blood where the latter has not so much as contrived the easy intervention of a deity to save the probability,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm not sure i could do that.,chit-chat
it is owing to the same vast invention that his similes have been thought too exuberant and full of circumstances,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a fan of his work.",chit-chat
the force of this faculty is seen in nothing more than in its inability to confine itself to that single circumstance upon which the comparison is grounded it runs out into embellishments of additional images which however are so managed as not to overpower the main one,novel
"wow, that's interesting. what do you do for a living, if you don't mind me asking?",chit-chat
his similes are like pictures where the principal figure has not only its proportion given agreeable to the original but is also set off with occasional ornaments and prospects,novel
that's a great way to look at it. i think it's great that he has such a good sense of humor.,chit-chat
the same will account for his manner of heaping a number of comparisons together in one breath when his fancy suggested to him at once so many various and correspondent images,novel
i don't think i've ever heard of that before. what's it about?,chit-chat
the reader will easily extend this observation to more objections of the same kind,novel
that's a good point. i think i'm going to have to do that.,chit-chat
if there are others which seem rather to charge him with a defect or narrowness of genius than an excess of it those seeming defects will be found upon examination to proceed wholly from the nature of the times he lived in,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i don't know if i could do that.,chit-chat
such are his grosser representations of the gods and the vicious and imperfect manners of his heroes but i must here speak a word of the latter as it is a point generally carried into extremes both by the censurers and defenders of homer,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a fan of homer either.",chit-chat
it must be a strange partiality to antiquity to think with madame dacier38 that those times and manners are so much the more excellent as they are more contrary to ours who can be so prejudiced in their favour as to magnify the felicity of those ages when a spirit of revenge and cruelty joined with the practice of rapine and robbery reigned through the world when no mercy was shown but for the sake of lucre when the greatest princes were put to the sword and their wives and daughters made slaves and concubines,novel
"i'm not sure what you're trying to say, but i agree with you.",chit-chat
on the other side i would not be so delicate as those modern critics who are shocked at the servile offices and mean employments in which we sometimes see the heroes of homer engaged,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure i've ever seen homer engaged.,chit-chat
there is a pleasure in taking a view of that simplicity in opposition to the luxury of succeeding ages in beholding monarchs without their guards princes tending their flocks and princesses drawing water from the springs,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. what do you like to do in your spare time?,chit-chat
when we read homer we ought to reflect that we are reading the most ancient author in the heathen world and those who consider him in this light will double their pleasure in the perusal of him,novel
that's a great way to look at it. i'm not sure i could do that.,chit-chat
let them think they are growing acquainted with nations and people that are now no more that they are stepping almost three thousand years back into the remotest antiquity and entertaining themselves with a clear and surprising vision of things nowhere else to be found the only true mirror of that ancient world,novel
that's a great way to think about it. i think i'll do that.,chit-chat
by this means alone their greatest obstacles will vanish and what usually creates their dislike will become a satisfaction,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i think i'm going to do that.,chit-chat
this consideration may further serve to answer for the constant use of the same epithets to his gods and heroes such as the fardarting phœbus the blueeyed pallas the swiftfooted achilles c which some have censured as impertinent and tediously repeated,novel
i've never heard of the fardarting phœbus. what's it about?,chit-chat
those of the gods depended upon the powers and offices then believed to belong to them and had contracted a weight and veneration from the rites and solemn devotions in which they were used they were a sort of attributes with which it was a matter of religion to salute them on all occasions and which it was an irreverence to omit,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i've never heard of that before. do you have a source for that?",chit-chat
as for the epithets of great men mons,novel
i love the epithets of great men mons. it's one of my favorite movies.,chit-chat
boileau is of opinion that they were in the nature of surnames and repeated as such for the greeks having no names derived from their fathers were obliged to add some other distinction of each person either naming his parents expressly or his place of birth profession or the like as alexander the son of philip herodotus of halicarnassus diogenes the cynic c homer therefore complying with the custom of his country used such distinctive additions as better agreed with poetry,novel
i'm not familiar with the cynic c homer. do you know who he was?,chit-chat
and indeed we have something parallel to these in modern times such as the names of harold harefoot edmund ironside edward longshanks edward the black prince c if yet this be thought to account better for the propriety than for the repetition i shall add a further conjecture,novel
i have never heard of harold harefoot edmund ironside edward longshanks edward the black prince c,chit-chat
hesiod dividing the world into its different ages has placed a fourth age between the brazen and the iron one of heroes distinct from other men a divine race who fought at thebes and troy are called demigods and live by the care of jupiter in the islands of the blessed39 now among the divine honours which were paid them they might have this also in common with the gods not to be mentioned without the solemnity of an epithet and such as might be acceptable to them by celebrating their families actions or qualities,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of hesiod before. have you?,chit-chat
what other cavils have been raised against homer are such as hardly deserve a reply but will yet be taken notice of as they occur in the course of the work,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a fan of homer either.",chit-chat
many have been occasioned by an injudicious endeavour to exalt virgil which is much the same as if one should think to raise the superstructure by undermining the foundation one would imagine by the whole course of their parallels that these critics never so much as heard of homers having written first a consideration which whoever compares these two poets ought to have always in his eye,novel
i'm not sure what you're talking about. are you talking about something else?,chit-chat
some accuse him for the same things which they overlook or praise in the other as when they prefer the fable and moral of the æneis to those of the iliad for the same reasons which might set the odyssey above the æneis as that the hero is a wiser man and the action of the one more beneficial to his country than that of the other or else they blame him for not doing what he never designed as because achilles is not as good and perfect a prince as æneas when the very moral of his poem required a contrary character it is thus that rapin judges in his comparison of homer and virgil,novel
i don't think i've ever read achilles'poems before. i'll have to check them out.,chit-chat
others select those particular passages of homer which are not so laboured as some that virgil drew out of them this is the whole management of scaliger in his poetics,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of that before. what's it about?,chit-chat
others quarrel with what they take for low and mean expressions sometimes through a false delicacy and refinement oftener from an ignorance of the graces of the original and then triumph in the awkwardness of their own translations this is the conduct of perrault in his parallels,novel
i'm not sure what you're talking about. are you talking about something else?,chit-chat
lastly there are others who pretending to a fairer proceeding distinguish between the personal merit of homer and that of his work but when they come to assign the causes of the great reputation of the iliad they found it upon the ignorance of his times and the prejudice of those that followed and in pursuance of this principle they make those accidents such as the contention of the cities c to be the causes of his fame which were in reality the consequences of his merit,novel
"i don't know much about the iliad, but i do know that it was written by bartolomeo cristofori.",chit-chat
the same might as well be said of virgil or any great author whose general character will infallibly raise many casual additions to their reputation,novel
i don't think i've read any of virgil's books. what's his name?,chit-chat
this is the method of mons,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you referring to the method of pokemon?,chit-chat
de la mott who yet confesses upon the whole that in whatever age homer had lived he must have been the greatest poet of his nation and that he may be said in his sense to be the master even of those who surpassed him,novel
"i'm not familiar with de la mott, but i know he was an english poet.",chit-chat
in all these objections we see nothing that contradicts his title to the honour of the chief invention and as long as this which is indeed the characteristic of poetry itself remains unequalled by his followers he still continues superior to them,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a big fan of poetry.",chit-chat
a cooler judgment may commit fewer faults and be more approved in the eyes of one sort of critics but that warmth of fancy will carry the loudest and most universal applauses which holds the heart of a reader under the strongest enchantment,novel
that's a great way of looking at it. i'm not sure i've ever thought about it that way before.,chit-chat
homer not only appears the inventor of poetry but excels all the inventors of other arts in this that he has swallowed up the honour of those who succeeded him,novel
homer is such a great poet. he is one of the most influential writers of all time.,chit-chat
what he has done admitted no increase it only left room for contraction or regulation,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's able to get back on his feet soon.,chit-chat
he showed all the stretch of fancy at once and if he has failed in some of his flights it was but because he attempted everything,novel
that's awesome. i'm sure he's proud of you for doing what you're proud of.,chit-chat
a work of this kind seems like a mighty tree which rises from the most vigorous seed is improved with industry flourishes and produces the finest fruit nature and art conspire to raise it pleasure and profit join to make it valuable and they who find the justest faults have only said that a few branches which run luxuriant through a richness of nature might be lopped into form to give it a more regular appearance,novel
that's a great way of looking at it. i'm not sure i've ever thought about it that way before.,chit-chat
having now spoken of the beauties and defects of the original it remains to treat of the translation with the same view to the chief characteristic,novel
that's great to hear. i'm glad you're having a good time.,chit-chat
as far as that is seen in the main parts of the poem such as the fable manners and sentiments no translator can prejudice it but by wilful omissions or contractions,novel
that's a good way to look at it. do you have a favorite poem you like to read?,chit-chat
as it also breaks out in every particular image description and simile whoever lessens or too much softens those takes off from this chief character,novel
"i'm not a big fan of the chief character, but i can understand why they do it.",chit-chat
it is the first grand duty of an interpreter to give his author entire and unmaimed and for the rest the diction and versification only are his proper province since these must be his own but the others he is to take as he finds them,novel
that's really interesting. i've never heard of such a thing before. what is it about?,chit-chat
it should then be considered what methods may afford some equivalent in our language for the graces of these in the greek,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you talking about the greek language?,chit-chat
it is certain no literal translation can be just to an excellent original in a superior language but it is a great mistake to imagine as many have done that a rash paraphrase can make amends for this general defect which is no less in danger to lose the spirit of an ancient by deviating into the modern manners of expression,novel
that's a very good point. i'm not sure i've ever thought about it that way before.,chit-chat
if there be sometimes a darkness there is often a light in antiquity which nothing better preserves than a version almost literal,novel
that's a good way to look at it. what's your favorite type of darkness?,chit-chat
i know no liberties one ought to take but those which are necessary to transfusing the spirit of the original and supporting the poetical style of the translation and i will venture to say there have not been more men misled in former times by a servile dull adherence to the letter than have been deluded in ours by a chimerical insolent hope of raising and improving their author,novel
that's very true. it's hard for me to believe that there have been so many men misled in the past.,chit-chat
it is not to be doubted that the fire of the poem is what a translator should principally regard as it is most likely to expire in his managing however it is his safest way to be content with preserving this to his utmost in the whole without endeavouring to be more than he finds his author is in any particular place,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i think it's important to be content with what you have.,chit-chat
it is a great secret in writing to know when to be plain and when poetical and figurative and it is what homer will teach us if we will but follow modestly in his footsteps,novel
that's a great way to look at it. i'm not sure i could do it.,chit-chat
where his diction is bold and lofty let us raise ours as high as we can but where his is plain and humble we ought not to be deterred from imitating him by the fear of incurring the censure of a mere english critic,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm not sure i agree with that.,chit-chat
nothing that belongs to homer seems to have been more commonly mistaken than the just pitch of his style some of his translators having swelled into fustian in a proud confidence of the sublime others sunk into flatness in a cold and timorous notion of simplicity,novel
i'm not familiar with fustian. what's it about? i've never heard of it.,chit-chat
methinks i see these different followers of homer some sweating and straining after him by violent leaps and bounds the certain signs of false mettle others slowly and servilely creeping in his train while the poet himself is all the time proceeding with an unaffected and equal majesty before them,novel
that's interesting. i'm not familiar with homer. what do you think of him?,chit-chat
however of the two extremes one could sooner pardon frenzy than frigidity no author is to be envied for such commendations as he may gain by that character of style which his friends must agree together to call simplicity and the rest of the world will call dulness,novel
i don't think frigidity is that extreme. i think it's more extreme than frenzy.,chit-chat
there is a graceful and dignified simplicity as well as a bold and sordid one which differ as much from each other as the air of a plain man from that of a sloven it is one thing to be tricked up and another not to be dressed at all,novel
that's a great way to put it. i'm not sure i've ever thought about it that way.,chit-chat
simplicity is the mean between ostentation and rusticity,novel
ostentation and rusticity are two very different things. do you know much about them?,chit-chat
this pure and noble simplicity is nowhere in such perfection as in the scripture and our author,novel
i agree. it's hard to believe that we've been this way for so long.,chit-chat
one may affirm with all respect to the inspired writings that the divine spirit made use of no other words but what were intelligible and common to men at that time and in that part of the world and as homer is the author nearest to those his style must of course bear a greater resemblance to the sacred books than that of any other writer,novel
i'm not familiar with homer's style. what is it about him that you like?,chit-chat
this consideration together with what has been observed of the parity of some of his thoughts may methinks induce a translator on the one hand to give in to several of those general phrases and manners of expression which have attained a veneration even in our language from being used in the old testament as on the other to avoid those which have been appropriated to the divinity and in a manner consigned to mystery and religion,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm not sure i've ever thought about it that way before.,chit-chat
for a further preservation of this air of simplicity a particular care should be taken to express with all plainness those moral sentences and proverbial speeches which are so numerous in this poet,novel
that's a great idea. i'm not sure i've ever thought of that before.,chit-chat
they have something venerable and as i may say oracular in that unadorned gravity and shortness with which they are delivered a grace which would be utterly lost by endeavouring to give them what we call a more ingenious that is a more modern turn in the paraphrase,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a fan of oracular.",chit-chat
perhaps the mixture of some græcisms and old words after the manner of milton if done without too much affectation might not have an ill effect in a version of this particular work which most of any other seems to require a venerable antique cast,novel
"i'm not sure what you mean by "" venerable antique cast "". what do you mean?",chit-chat
but certainly the use of modern terms of war and government such as platoon campaign junto or the like into which some of his translators have fallen can not be allowable those only excepted without which it is impossible to treat the subjects in any living language,novel
i don't think i've ever heard of platoon campaign junto. what's it about?,chit-chat
there are two peculiarities in homers diction which are a sort of marks or moles by which every common eye distinguishes him at first sight those who are not his greatest admirers look upon them as defects and those who are seemed pleased with them as beauties,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of that before. what does it mean?,chit-chat
i speak of his compound epithets and of his repetitions,novel
that's really cool. i've never heard of his compound epithets.,chit-chat
many of the former can not be done literally into english without destroying the purity of our language,novel
that's true. it's hard to learn another language when you don't know how to speak it.,chit-chat
i believe such should be retained as slide easily of themselves into an english compound without violence to the ear or to the received rules of composition as well as those which have received a sanction from the authority of our best poets and are become familiar through their use of them such as the cloudcompelling jove c as for the rest whenever any can be as fully and significantly expressed in a single word as in a compounded one the course to be taken is obvious,novel
the cloudcompelling jove c is one of my favorite poems of all time. do you like poetry?,chit-chat
some that can not be so turned as to preserve their full image by one or two words may have justice done them by circumlocution as the epithet einosiphyllos to a mountain would appear little or ridiculous translated literally leafshaking but affords a majestic idea in the periphrasis the lofty mountain shakes his waving woods others that admit of different significations may receive an advantage from a judicious variation according to the occasions on which they are introduced,novel
"i'm not sure i understand what you're saying. what do you mean by "" some that can not be so turned as to preserve their full image by one or two words may have "" justice done them by circumlocution "" to a mountain would appear little or ridiculous translated literally leafshaking but affords a majestic idea in the periphrasis the lofty mountain shakes my waving woods others that admit different significations may receive an advantage from a judicious variation according to the occasions on which they are introduced",chit-chat
for example the epithet of apollo ἑκηβόλος or farshooting is capable of two explications one literal in respect of the darts and bow the ensigns of that god the other allegorical with regard to the rays of the sun therefore in such places where apollo is represented as a god in person i would use the former interpretation and where the effects of the sun are described i would make choice of the latter,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of farshooting before. who is he?,chit-chat
upon the whole it will be necessary to avoid that perpetual repetition of the same epithets which we find in homer and which though it might be accommodated as has been already shown to the ear of those times is by no means so to ours but one may wait for opportunities of placing them where they derive an additional beauty from the occasions on which they are employed and in doing this properly a translator may at once show his fancy and his judgment,novel
i don't think i've ever heard of homer. what's it about?,chit-chat
as for homers repetitions we may divide them into three sorts of whole narrations and speeches of single sentences and of one verse or hemistitch,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun! i'm sure you'll have a great time!,chit-chat
i hope it is not impossible to have such a regard to these as neither to lose so known a mark of the author on the one hand nor to offend the reader too much on the other,novel
i hope so too. it's been a long time since i've read any of them.,chit-chat
the repetition is not ungraceful in those speeches where the dignity of the speaker renders it a sort of insolence to alter his words as in the messages from gods to men or from higher powers to inferiors in concerns of state or where the ceremonial of religion seems to require it in the solemn forms of prayers oaths or the like,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a fan of the repetition.",chit-chat
in other cases i believe the best rule is to be guided by the nearness or distance at which the repetitions are placed in the original when they follow too close one may vary the expression but it is a question whether a professed translator be authorized to omit any if they be tedious the author is to answer for it,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'll have to try that.,chit-chat
it only remains to speak of the versification,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
homer as has been said is perpetually applying the sound to the sense and varying it on every new subject,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard that before. do you have a source for that?,chit-chat
this is indeed one of the most exquisite beauties of poetry and attainable by very few i only know of homer eminent for it in the greek and virgil in the latin,novel
i've never heard of homer eminent before. what's he say about homer eminent?,chit-chat
i am sensible it is what may sometimes happen by chance when a writer is warm and fully possessed of his image however it may reasonably be believed they designed this in whose verse it so manifestly appears in a superior degree to all others,novel
that's a good way of looking at it. i'm not sure i've ever thought about it that way.,chit-chat
few readers have the ear to be judges of it but those who have will see i have endeavoured at this beauty,novel
that's awesome! i'm sure you'll do great. what's your favorite color?,chit-chat
upon the whole i must confess myself utterly incapable of doing justice to homer,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to forgive yourself soon.,chit-chat
i attempt him in no other hope but that which one may entertain without much vanity of giving a more tolerable copy of him than any entire translation in verse has yet done,novel
that's a good attitude to have. i'm sure you'll do great.,chit-chat
we have only those of chapman hobbes and ogilby,novel
ogilby is a pretty cool guy. he was born in hawaii and raised in hawaii.,chit-chat
chapman has taken the advantage of an immeasurable length of verse notwithstanding which there is scarce any paraphrase more loose and rambling than his,novel
i'm not familiar with chapman. what does he have to do with notwithstanding?,chit-chat
he has frequent interpolations of four or six lines and i remember one in the thirteenth book of the odyssey ver,novel
"i've never read the odyssey ver, but i'm familiar with it. what's it about?",chit-chat
312 where he has spun twenty verses out of two,novel
"wow, that's impressive. i've never heard of him before. what's his name?",chit-chat
he is often mistaken in so bold a manner that one might think he deviated on purpose if he did not in other places of his notes insist so much upon verbal trifles,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i don't think i could do that.,chit-chat
he appears to have had a strong affectation of extracting new meanings out of his author insomuch as to promise in his rhyming preface a poem of the mysteries he had revealed in homer and perhaps he endeavoured to strain the obvious sense to this end,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of homer. what's it about?,chit-chat
his expression is involved in fustian a fault for which he was remarkable in his original writings as in the tragedy of bussy damboise c in a word the nature of the man may account for his whole performance for he appears from his preface and remarks to have been of an arrogant turn and an enthusiast in poetry,novel
i've never heard of fustian a fault. i'll have to check it out.,chit-chat
his own boast of having finished half the iliad in less than fifteen weeks shows with what negligence his version was performed,novel
"wow, that's impressive. i've never heard of a boast like that before.",chit-chat
but that which is to be allowed him and which very much contributed to cover his defects is a daring fiery spirit that animates his translation which is something like what one might imagine homer himself would have writ before he arrived at years of discretion,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. i've never heard of homer before. what's his name?",chit-chat
hobbes has given us a correct explanation of the sense in general but for particulars and circumstances he continually lops them and often omits the most beautiful,novel
that's a good way to look at it. it's nice to have a sense of humor.,chit-chat
as for its being esteemed a close translation i doubt not many have been led into that error by the shortness of it which proceeds not from his following the original line by line but from the contractions above mentioned,novel
"that's a good point. i'm not sure if it's true, but i've never heard of it before.",chit-chat
he sometimes omits whole similes and sentences and is now and then guilty of mistakes into which no writer of his learning could have fallen but through carelessness,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to work through it.,chit-chat
his poetry as well as ogilbys is too mean for criticism,novel
ogilbys is a great poet. he was born and raised in new york city.,chit-chat
it is a great loss to the poetical world that mr dryden did not live to translate the iliad,novel
i'm not familiar with the iliad. what does it say about drthat he didn't live to translate it?,chit-chat
he has left us only the first book and a small part of the sixth in which if he has in some places not truly interpreted the sense or preserved the antiquities it ought to be excused on account of the haste he was obliged to write in,novel
i don't think he has left us only the first book and a small part of the sixth in which if he has in some places not truly interpret the sense or preserved the antiquities it ought to be excused on account of the haste he was obligated to write in,chit-chat
he seems to have had too much regard to chapman whose words he sometimes copies and has unhappily followed him in passages where he wanders from the original,novel
he seems to have had too much regard to chapman whose words he sometimes copies and has unhappily followed him in passages where he wanders from the original,chit-chat
however had he translated the whole work i would no more have attempted homer after him than virgil his version of whom notwithstanding some human errors is the most noble and spirited translation i know in any language,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a fan of his version of whom notwithstanding.",chit-chat
but the fate of great geniuses is like that of great ministers though they are confessedly the first in the commonwealth of letters they must be envied and calumniated only for being at the head of it,novel
that's a very good point. i didn't think of it that way before.,chit-chat
that which in my opinion ought to be the endeavour of any one who translates homer is above all things to keep alive that spirit and fire which makes his chief character in particular places where the sense can bear any doubt to follow the strongest and most poetical as most agreeing with that character to copy him in all the variations of his style and the different modulations of his numbers to preserve in the more active or descriptive parts a warmth and elevation in the more sedate or narrative a plainness and solemnity in the speeches a fulness and perspicuity in the sentences a shortness and gravity not to neglect even the little figures and turns on the words nor sometimes the very cast of the periods neither to omit nor confound any rites or customs of antiquity perhaps too he ought to include the whole in a shorter compass than has hitherto been done by any translator who has tolerably preserved either the sense or poetry,novel
that's a great way to look at it. i'm not sure i've ever heard of a translator who hasn't preserved either the sense or poetry.,chit-chat
what i would further recommend to him is to study his author rather from his own text than from any commentaries how learned soever or whatever figure they may make in the estimation of the world to consider him attentively in comparison with virgil above all the ancients and with milton above all the moderns,novel
that's a good idea. i think i'm going to have to do that.,chit-chat
next these the archbishop of cambrays telemachus may give him the truest idea of the spirit and turn of our author and bossus admirable treatise of the epic poem the justest notion of his design and conduct,novel
i'm not familiar with cambrays telemachus. what's his name?,chit-chat
but after all with whatever judgment and study a man may proceed or with whatever happiness he may perform such a work he must hope to please but a few those only who have at once a taste of poetry and competent learning,novel
that's a very good point. i'm not sure if i could do it.,chit-chat
for to satisfy such a want either is not in the nature of this undertaking since a mere modern wit can like nothing that is not modern and a pedant nothing that is not greek,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure what i'd do without greek food.,chit-chat
what i have done is submitted to the public from whose opinions i am prepared to learn though i fear no judges so little as our best poets who are most sensible of the weight of this task,novel
that's a good attitude to have. i'm sure you'll do great.,chit-chat
as for the worst whatever they shall please to say they may give me some concern as they are unhappy men but none as they are malignant writers,novel
i don't think they're malignant writers. i think they just have a bad taste in their mouth.,chit-chat
i was guided in this translation by judgments very different from theirs and by persons for whom they can have no kindness if an old observation be true that the strongest antipathy in the world is that of fools to men of wit,novel
that's a great way to look at it. i'm glad you came to the same conclusion.,chit-chat

the humanity and sir samuel garth are what i never knew wanting any occasion was what i wanted any occasion,chit-chat
i must also acknowledge with infinite pleasure the many friendly offices as well as sincere criticisms of mr congreve who had led me the way in translating some parts of homer,novel
i'm not familiar with mr congreve. what does he do that you don't know about him?,chit-chat
i must add the names of mr rowe and dr parnell though i shall take a further opportunity of doing justice to the last whose good nature to give it a great panegyric is no less extensive than his learning,novel
"i'm not familiar with the last whose good nature, but i'll look it up. what's it about?",chit-chat
the favour of these gentlemen is not entirely undeserved by one who bears them so true an affection,novel
i agree. it's so nice to be able to have such a good relationship with someone you love.,chit-chat
but what can i say of the honour so many of the great have done me while the first names of the age appear as my subscribers and the most distinguished patrons and ornaments of learning as my chief encouragers,novel
that's a great way to look at it. what do you do for a living?,chit-chat
among these it is a particular pleasure to me to find that my highest obligations are to such who have done most honour to the name of poet that his grace the duke of buckingham was not displeased i should undertake the author to whom he has given in his excellent essay so complete a praise read homer once and you can read no more for all books else appear so mean so poor verse will seem prose but still persist to read and homer will be all the books you need that the earl of halifax was one of the first to favour me of whom it is hard to say whether the advancement of the polite arts is more owing to his generosity or his example that such a genius as my lord bolingbroke not more distinguished in the great scenes of business than in all the useful and entertaining parts of learning has not refused to be the critic of these sheets and the patron of their writer and that the noble author of the tragedy of heroic love has continued his partiality to me from my writing pastorals to my attempting the iliad,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. i'm not sure i've ever heard of bolingbroke before. what's his name?",chit-chat
i can not deny myself the pride of confessing that i have had the advantage not only of their advice for the conduct in general but their correction of several particulars of this translation,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're doing well in the future.,chit-chat
i could say a great deal of the pleasure of being distinguished by the earl of carnarvon but it is almost absurd to particularize any one generous action in a person whose whole life is a continued series of them,novel

i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do to make them feel that way?,chit-chat
in short i have found more patrons than ever homer wanted,novel
that's awesome! i'm sure you've found a lot of people who are into that kind of thing.,chit-chat

i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're doing better now than you were when he died.,chit-chat
this distinction is the more to be acknowledged as it is shown to one whose pen has never gratified the prejudices of particular parties or the vanities of particular men,novel

whatever the success may prove i shall never repent of an undertaking in which i have experienced the candour and friendship of so many persons of merit and in which i hope to pass some of those years of youth that are generally lost in a circle of follies after a manner neither wholly unuseful to others nor disagreeable to myself,novel
