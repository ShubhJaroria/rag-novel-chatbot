mrs,novel
have you ever been to the united states? it's a sovereign state in north america.,chit-chat

mr,novel
have you ever heard of mr. robot? it's a tv series based on mr. mr. universe.,chit-chat
darling was frightfully proud of her but he was very honourable and he sat on the edge of mrs darlings bed holding her hand and calculating expenses while she looked at him imploringly,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did darling do to make him feel that way?,chit-chat
she wanted to risk it come what might but that was not his way his way was with a pencil and a piece of paper and if she confused him with suggestions he had to begin at the beginning again,novel

now dont interrupt he would beg of her,novel

i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope he's doing better now that you have him.,chit-chat
darling had a passion for being exactly like his neighbours so of course they had a nurse,novel
that's a good point. i don't think i've ever seen a nurse before.,chit-chat
as they were poor owing to the amount of milk the children drank this nurse was a prim newfoundland dog called nana who had belonged to no one in particular until the darlings engaged her,novel
that's so sad. i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she's doing better now.,chit-chat
she had always thought children important however and the darlings had become acquainted with her in kensington gardens where she spent most of her spare time peeping into perambulators and was much hated by careless nursemaids whom she followed to their homes and complained of to their mistresses,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i didn't know she was a nursemaid.",chit-chat
she proved to be quite a treasure of a nurse,novel

how thorough she was at bathtime and up at any moment of the night if one of her charges made the slightest cry,novel

of course her kennel was in the nursery,novel
"i know, right? i was so mad at her for doing that. i felt so bad for her.",chit-chat

she believed to her last day in oldfashioned remedies like rhubarb leaf and made sounds of contempt over all this newfangled talk about germs and so on,novel

on johns footer days she never once forgot his sweater and she usually carried an umbrella in her mouth in case of rain,novel

there is a room in the basement of miss fulsoms school where the nurses wait,novel
that's cool. i've never been to miss fulsoms school. what is it like?,chit-chat
they sat on forms while nana lay on the floor but that was the only difference,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. did you get to see any of the other matches?,chit-chat
they affected to ignore her as of an inferior social status to themselves and she despised their light talk,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she's able to get over it.,chit-chat
she resented visits to the nursery from mrs darlings friends but if they did come she first whipped off michaels pinafore and put him into the one with blue braiding and smoothed out wendy and made a dash at johns hair,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. what did she do to get him to do that?,chit-chat
no nursery could possibly have been conducted more correctly and mr,novel
that's what i was thinking. i don't know what to do with myself.,chit-chat
darling knew it yet he sometimes wondered uneasily whether the neighbours talked,novel
that's a good way to look at it. what did darling say to the neighbors?,chit-chat
he had his position in the city to consider,novel
that's good to hear. i'm glad he's doing well in the city.,chit-chat
nana also troubled him in another way,novel
i don't know what you mean by that. are you referring to something i'm not aware of?,chit-chat
he had sometimes a feeling that she did not admire him,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did he do to make you feel that way?,chit-chat
i know she admires you tremendously george mrs,novel
i love george mrs. he's such a great man. i wish i could have known him when i was younger.,chit-chat
darling would assure him and then she would sign to the children to be specially nice to father,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i think she would be a good parent.,chit-chat
lovely dances followed in which the only other servant liza was sometimes allowed to join,novel
that's so cool! i've never heard of such a thing before. i'll have to check it out.,chit-chat

"wow, that's a big deal. i'm sorry to hear that. what happened?",chit-chat
the gaiety of those romps,novel

and gayest of all was mrs,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope she's doing better now. what happened to her?,chit-chat
darling who would pirouette so wildly that all you could see of her was the kiss and then if you had dashed at her you might have got it,novel
i don't think i could do that. i'm not very good at flirting.,chit-chat
there never was a simpler happier family until the coming of peter pan,novel
what happened to peter pan? i've never heard of him. what's his name?,chit-chat
mrs,novel
have you ever been to the united states? it's a sovereign state in north america.,chit-chat
darling first heard of peter when she was tidying up her childrens minds,novel
"aww, that's so sweet of her. i've never heard of him.",chit-chat
it is the nightly custom of every good mother after her children are asleep to rummage in their minds and put things straight for next morning repacking into their proper places the many articles that have wandered during the day,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i don't think i could do that.,chit-chat
if you could keep awake but of course you cant you would see your own mother doing this and you would find it very interesting to watch her,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure if i'd be able to keep up with her.,chit-chat
it is quite like tidying up drawers,novel
tidying up? what does that mean? i'm not sure what that means lol,chit-chat
you would see her on her knees i expect lingering humorously over some of your contents wondering where on earth you had picked this thing up making discoveries sweet and not so sweet pressing this to her cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten and hurriedly stowing that out of sight,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i don't think i could do that.,chit-chat
when you wake in the morning the naughtiness and evil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind and on the top beautifully aired are spread out your prettier thoughts ready for you to put on,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm not sure i've ever felt that way before.,chit-chat
i dont know whether you have ever seen a map of a persons mind,novel
i've never seen a map of a person's mind. what's it about?,chit-chat
doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you and your own map can become intensely interesting but catch them trying to draw a map of a childs mind which is not only confused but keeps going round all the time,novel
that's interesting. i've never seen a map of a childs mind before.,chit-chat
there are zigzag lines on it just like your temperature on a card and these are probably roads in the island for the neverland is always more or less an island with astonishing splashes of colour here and there and coral reefs and rakishlooking craft in the offing and savages and lonely lairs and gnomes who are mostly tailors and caves through which a river runs and princes with six elder brothers and a hut fast going to decay and one very small old lady with a hooked nose,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun! i'd love to visit one of these islands one day.,chit-chat
it would be an easy map if that were all but there is also first day at school religion fathers the round pond needlework murders hangings verbs that take the dative chocolate pudding day getting into braces say ninetynine threepence for pulling out your tooth yourself and so on and either these are part of the island or they are another map showing through and it is all rather confusing especially as nothing will stand still,novel
"wow, that's a lot of information. i'll have to look into that.",chit-chat
of course the neverlands vary a good deal,novel
"yeah, it's a good deal. i think i'm going to pick it up.",chit-chat
johns for instance had a lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which john was shooting while michael who was very small had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it,novel
i've never heard of john's lagoon. i'll have to check it out.,chit-chat
john lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands michael in a wigwam wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together,novel
i've never heard of michael in a wigwam wendy. what is it about?,chit-chat
john had no friends michael had friends at night wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents but on the whole the neverlands have a family resemblance and if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have each others nose and so forth,novel
i've never heard of the wolf forsaken. what's it look like?,chit-chat
on these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching their coracles,novel
i don't think i've ever beached my coracles. i'm not sure what that means.,chit-chat
we too have been there we can still hear the sound of the surf though we shall land no more,novel
that's good to hear. it's always good to be prepared for the worst.,chit-chat
of all delectable islands the neverland is the snuggest and most compact not large and sprawly you know with tedious distances between one adventure and another but nicely crammed,novel
"i've never been to the neverland, but i'd love to go. have you been?",chit-chat
when you play at it by day with the chairs and tablecloth it is not in the least alarming but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes very real,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm not sure i could do that.,chit-chat
that is why there are nightlights,novel
i didn't know there were nightlights. i'll have to look into that.,chit-chat
occasionally in her travels through her childrens minds mrs,novel
that's really sweet of her. i'm sure she's very proud of you.,chit-chat
darling found things she could not understand and of these quite the most perplexing was the word peter,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did darling find that she couldn't understand?,chit-chat
she knew of no peter and yet he was here and there in john and michaels minds while wendys began to be scrawled all over with him,novel
that's pretty crazy. i'm glad she didn't do anything to him.,chit-chat
the name stood out in bolder letters than any of the other words and as mrs,novel
i didn't even notice until you pointed it out. what's your favorite letter?,chit-chat
darling gazed she felt that it had an oddly cocky appearance,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do to make her feel that way?,chit-chat
yes he is rather cocky wendy admitted with regret,novel
i don't think so. i think he's just trying to make himself feel better.,chit-chat
her mother had been questioning her,novel
that's so sad. i hope she's okay. i'm sorry to hear that.,chit-chat
but who is he my pet he is peter pan you know mother at first mrs,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find peace with him.,chit-chat
darling did not know but after thinking back into her childhood she just remembered a peter pan who was said to live with the fairies,novel
"that's really cool. i've never seen the movie, but i hear it's pretty good.",chit-chat
there were odd stories about him as that when children died he went part of the way with them so that they should not be frightened,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of that before. what was it about?,chit-chat
she had believed in him at the time but now that she was married and full of sense she quite doubted whether there was any such person,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she's able to get over it.,chit-chat
besides she said to wendy he would be grown up by this time oh no he isnt grown up wendy assured her confidently and he is just my size she meant that he was her size in both mind and body she didnt know how she knew she just knew it,novel
that's a good point. it's hard for me to believe that she didn't know that.,chit-chat
mrs,novel
have you ever been to the united states? it's a sovereign state in north america.,chit-chat
darling consulted mr,novel
have you ever heard of darling darling mr? it's a fictional character from the american horror story series.,chit-chat
darling but he smiled poohpooh,novel
that's so cute! i've never seen a dog smile like that before. do you like dogs?,chit-chat
mark my words he said it is some nonsense nana has been putting into their heads just the sort of idea a dog would have,novel
i don't think i've ever heard of nana. what's it about?,chit-chat
leave it alone and it will blow over but it would not blow over and soon the troublesome boy gave mrs,novel
that's a good point. i guess i'll just have to wait and see.,chit-chat
darling quite a shock,novel
"i know, i was so shocked. it's been a while since i've seen it.",chit-chat
children have the strangest adventures without being troubled by them,novel
"that's true, but i'm not sure if i'd want to be a parent.",chit-chat
for instance they may remember to mention a week after the event happened that when they were in the wood they had met their dead father and had a game with him,novel
that's a really good idea. i'll try to remember that for next time.,chit-chat
it was in this casual way that wendy one morning made a disquieting revelation,novel
what did she say? i've never heard of a disquieting revelation before. what was it about?,chit-chat
some leaves of a tree had been found on the nursery floor which certainly were not there when the children went to bed and mrs,novel
"oh no, that's terrible. i'm so sorry you had to go through that.",chit-chat
darling was puzzling over them when wendy said with a tolerant smile i do believe it is that peter again whatever do you mean wendy it is so naughty of him not to wipe his feet wendy said sighing,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. i don't understand what you're saying.,chit-chat
she was a tidy child,novel
that's good to hear. what did she do to make you think she was tidy?,chit-chat
she explained in quite a matteroffact way that she thought peter sometimes came to the nursery in the night and sat on the foot of her bed and played on his pipes to her,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. did you find out who did it or did she tell you?",chit-chat
unfortunately she never woke so she didnt know how she knew she just knew,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. do you think she'll be able to get over it?,chit-chat
what nonsense you talk precious,novel
i don't know what i'm talking about. i just want to be happy.,chit-chat
no one can get into the house without knocking i think he comes in by the window she said,novel
that's not good. i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's ok.,chit-chat
my love it is three floors up were not the leaves at the foot of the window mother it was quite true the leaves had been found very near the window,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. did you find out who did it or was it someone else?",chit-chat
mrs,novel
have you ever been to the united states? it's a sovereign state in north america.,chit-chat
darling did not know what to think for it all seemed so natural to wendy that you could not dismiss it by saying she had been dreaming,novel
"that's a good point. i didn't think about it that way, but it makes a lot of sense.",chit-chat
my child the mother cried why did you not tell me of this before i forgot said wendy lightly,novel
oh no! i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she's doing better now.,chit-chat
she was in a hurry to get her breakfast,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad you were able to get her breakfast.,chit-chat
oh surely she must have been dreaming,novel
i don't think so. i'm not sure if it was a dream or not.,chit-chat
but on the other hand there were the leaves,novel
"that's true, but it's not as bad as people make it out to be.",chit-chat
mrs,novel
have you ever been to the united states? it's a sovereign state in north america.,chit-chat
darling examined them very carefully they were skeleton leaves but she was sure they did not come from any tree that grew in england,novel
"that's interesting. i've never heard of them before, but i'm not familiar with them.",chit-chat
she crawled about the floor peering at it with a candle for marks of a strange foot,novel
"oh my god, that's so gross! i'd be so grossed out! what did you do?",chit-chat
she rattled the poker up the chimney and tapped the walls,novel
that's pretty cool. what did she do to make you think she did something like that?,chit-chat
she let down a tape from the window to the pavement and it was a sheer drop of thirty feet without so much as a spout to climb up by,novel
"oh my god, that's terrible. i'm sorry you had to go through that.",chit-chat
certainly wendy had been dreaming,novel
i don't think so. i think it's more likely that she was dreaming about something else.,chit-chat
but wendy had not been dreaming as the very next night showed the night on which the extraordinary adventures of these children may be said to have begun,novel
i'm not sure what you're talking about. what do you mean by that?,chit-chat
on the night we speak of all the children were once more in bed,novel
"oh wow, that must have been a lot of fun. did you have a good time?",chit-chat
it happened to be nanas evening off and mrs,novel
that's really nice of them. i'm glad you got to spend time with them.,chit-chat
darling had bathed them and sung to them till one by one they had let go her hand and slid away into the land of sleep,novel
"awww, that's so sweet. i'm so sorry to hear that.",chit-chat
all were looking so safe and cosy that she smiled at her fears now and sat down tranquilly by the fire to sew,novel
that's so nice of her. i'm glad you were able to sew.,chit-chat
it was something for michael who on his birthday was getting into shirts,novel
that's really cool. what did you get him to get into the shirts for you?,chit-chat
the fire was warm however and the nursery dimly lit by three nightlights and presently the sewing lay on mrs darlings lap,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope it wasn't too bad for you.,chit-chat
then her head nodded oh so gracefully,novel
i know right! i was so happy to see her smile. she is such a beautiful woman.,chit-chat
she was asleep,novel
are you sure she wasn't asleep? i've had that happen to me before.,chit-chat
look at the four of them wendy and michael over there john here and mrs,novel

there should have been a fourth nightlight,novel
"i know, i was so scared. i had to get up and go to the bathroom.",chit-chat
while she slept she had a dream,novel

she dreamt that the neverland had come too near and that a strange boy had broken through from it,novel
"wow, that's crazy. what happened to the neverland? did you find out who it was?",chit-chat
he did not alarm her for she thought she had seen him before in the faces of many women who have no children,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he didn't do that.,chit-chat
perhaps he is to be found in the faces of some mothers also,novel
that's what i'm thinking too. i don't know what to do.,chit-chat
but in her dream he had rent the film that obscures the neverland and she saw wendy and john and michael peeping through the gap,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. i've never heard of that movie before. what's it about?",chit-chat
the dream by itself would have been a trifle but while she was dreaming the window of the nursery blew open and a boy did drop on the floor,novel
"wow, that must have been a scary dream. did you have to go to the hospital?",chit-chat
he was accompanied by a strange light no bigger than your fist which darted about the room like a living thing and i think it must have been this light that wakened mrs,novel
"that's a good guess, but i don't think so. i think it was a ghost.",chit-chat
darling,novel
"have you ever heard of the term "" darling ""? it's a term that refers to a person's ability to express themselves in a particular way.",chit-chat

"oh my gosh, that's so sad. i'm so sorry to hear that.",chit-chat
if you or i or wendy had been there we should have seen that he was very like mrs darlings kiss,novel
that's what i was thinking. i'm glad he didn't do it.,chit-chat
he was a lovely boy clad in skeleton leaves and the juices that ooze out of trees but the most entrancing thing about him was that he had all his first teeth,novel
"wow, that's amazing! i bet he had a great life. i'm glad he's doing well now.",chit-chat

she returned to the nursery and found nana with something in her mouth which proved to be the boys shadow,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. did you find out who it was or what it was?",chit-chat

she thought of showing it to mr,novel
that's what i'm thinking too. i don't know what to do now.,chit-chat
darling but he was totting up winter greatcoats for john and michael with a wet towel around his head to keep his brain clear and it seemed a shame to trouble him besides she knew exactly what he would say it all comes of having a dog for a nurse she decided to roll the shadow up and put it away carefully in a drawer until a fitting opportunity came for telling her husband,novel
"awww, that's so sweet of him. i'm sure he appreciated it.",chit-chat
ah me,novel

the opportunity came a week later on that nevertobeforgotten friday,novel
"that's awesome! what opportunity did you get, if you don't mind me asking?",chit-chat
of course it was a friday,novel
"yes, it was. i was so mad at myself for not doing it earlier. i didn't know what to do.",chit-chat

darling would say scorning himself and indeed he had been like a tornado,novel
"i'm not sure what he meant by that, but i can't help but feel bad for him.",chit-chat
perhaps there was some excuse for him,novel
that's what i'm thinking too. i don't know what to do now.,chit-chat
he too had been dressing for the party and all had gone well with him until he came to his tie,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad he was able to get out of the house.,chit-chat
it is an astounding thing to have to tell but this man though he knew about stocks and shares had no real mastery of his tie,novel
that's very true. it's hard to know what to do when you don't know what you're doing.,chit-chat
sometimes the thing yielded to him without a contest but there were occasions when it would have been better for the house if he had swallowed his pride and used a madeup tie,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he didn't use a madeup tie.,chit-chat
this was such an occasion,novel
it really was. i'm glad you were able to have a good time with it.,chit-chat

"that's what i'm thinking, but i don't know what to do.",chit-chat

that's so sweet of her. i'm sure she's proud of him.,chit-chat
some men would have resented her being able to do it so easily but mr,novel
i don't think so. i'm a woman and i've never been able to do it.,chit-chat
darling had far too fine a nature for that he thanked her carelessly at once forgot his rage and in another moment was dancing round the room with michael on his back,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay. what did darling do?,chit-chat
how wildly we romped says mrs,novel

darling collided against her covering his trousers with hairs,novel
i've never heard of that before. are you sure it wasn't a dog?,chit-chat
they were not only new trousers but they were the first he had ever had with braid on them and he had had to bite his lip to prevent the tears coming,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad he didn't have to do that.,chit-chat
of course mrs,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you referring to my husband's name?,chit-chat
darling brushed him but he began to talk again about its being a mistake to have a dog for a nurse,novel
oh no! i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's doing better now.,chit-chat
george nana is a treasure no doubt but i have an uneasy feeling at times that she looks upon the children as puppies oh no dear one i feel sure she knows they have souls i wonder mr,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a fan of puppies.",chit-chat
darling said thoughtfully i wonder it was an opportunity his wife felt for telling him about the boy,novel
i don't think so. i think it was an opportunity for him to tell his wife.,chit-chat
at first he poohpoohed the story but he became thoughtful when she showed him the shadow,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad it worked out for him.,chit-chat
it is nobody i know he said examining it carefully but it does look a scoundrel we were still discussing it you remember says mr,novel
i don't know who you are talking about. what is scoundrel exactly?,chit-chat
darling when nana came in with michaels medicine,novel
i've never heard of darling when nana came into medicine. what's that about?,chit-chat
you will never carry the bottle in your mouth again nana and it is all my fault strong man though he was there is no doubt that he had behaved rather foolishly over the medicine,novel
i'm sorry you had to go through that. i hope you're doing better now.,chit-chat
if he had a weakness it was for thinking that all his life he had taken medicine boldly and so now when michael dodged the spoon in nanas mouth he had said reprovingly be a man michael wont wont michael cried naughtily,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think of it that way. i guess that makes sense.,chit-chat
mrs,novel
have you ever been to the united states? it's a sovereign state in north america.,chit-chat
darling left the room to get a chocolate for him and mr,novel
"awww, that's sweet of him. what kind of chocolate did he get?",chit-chat

i'm sorry to hear that. it's always good to have a good parent in your life.,chit-chat
darling said bravely and i would take it now as an example to you michael if i hadnt lost the bottle he had not exactly lost it he had climbed in the dead of night to the top of the wardrobe and hidden it there,novel
that's a good example. i'm glad he didn't lose it. what did he do with it?,chit-chat
what he did not know was that the faithful liza had found it and put it back on his washstand,novel
oh no! that's terrible. i hope he didn't have to clean it up.,chit-chat
i know where it is father wendy cried always glad to be of service,novel
thank you for your kind words. it's nice to have someone who can relate to me.,chit-chat

i thought you took it quite easily father that is not the point he retorted,novel
"that's what i thought at first, but then i realized that it's not the point he's trying to make.",chit-chat
the point is that there is more in my glass than in michaels spoon his proud heart was nearly bursting,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did he do to make you feel that way?,chit-chat
and it isnt fair i would say it though it were with my last breath it isnt fair father i am waiting said michael coldly,novel

darling whispered remember what i told you about that boy alas he would not listen,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you tell him about that boy alas he would not listen?,chit-chat

"wow, that's really interesting. what did he do to get her out of the kennel?",chit-chat
he was ashamed of himself and yet he did it,novel

it was all owing to his too affectionate nature which craved for admiration,novel

that's a good point. i didn't think of that. it's hard to tell sometimes.,chit-chat
are you sure wendy oh yes mrs,novel
i'm not sure. i've never heard of her before. what's her name?,chit-chat
darling quivered and went to the window,novel
oh no! i hope you were able to get out of the car and get back in!,chit-chat
it was securely fastened,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get back on your feet soon.,chit-chat
she looked out and the night was peppered with stars,novel
that's not good. i'm sorry to hear that. what did she do?,chit-chat
they were crowding round the house as if curious to see what was to take place there but she did not notice this nor that one or two of the smaller ones winked at her,novel
that's not good. i'm sorry to hear that. what did she do?,chit-chat
yet a nameless fear clutched at her heart and made her cry oh how i wish that i wasnt going to a party tonight even michael already half asleep knew that she was perturbed and he asked can anything harm us mother after the nightlights are lit nothing precious she said they are the eyes a mother leaves behind her to guard her children she went from bed to bed singing enchantments over them and little michael flung his arms round her,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get some rest.,chit-chat
mother he cried im glad of you they were the last words she was to hear from him for a long time,novel
that's so sweet of you to say. i'm glad he's doing better now.,chit-chat
no,novel
are you a fan of the beatles? they are one of my favorite bands. have you heard of them?,chit-chat
27 was only a few yards distant but there had been a slight fall of snow and father and mother darling picked their way over it deftly not to soil their shoes,novel
"wow, that's a lot of snow. i'm glad they didn't get hurt.",chit-chat
they were already the only persons in the street and all the stars were watching them,novel
they were already the only people in the street and all the stars were watching them...,chit-chat
stars are beautiful but they may not take an active part in anything they must just look on for ever,novel
that's very true. it's hard to believe that there are so many stars out there.,chit-chat
it is a punishment put on them for something they did so long ago that no star now knows what it was,novel
"that's a good way of looking at it, but i still feel bad for them.",chit-chat
so the older ones have become glassyeyed and seldom speak winking is the star language but the little ones still wonder,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of glassyeye eye. do you have a source for that?,chit-chat
they are not really friendly to peter who had a mischievous way of stealing up behind them and trying to blow them out but they are so fond of fun that they were on his side tonight and anxious to get the grownups out of the way,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get the grownups out of the way.,chit-chat
so as soon as the door of 27 closed on mr and mrs,novel
"i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're feeling better now, though.",chit-chat
darling there was a commotion in the firmament and the smallest of all the stars in the milky way screamed out now peter chapter iii,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find peace.,chit-chat
come away come away,novel
i don't know what i'm going to do... i can't stop thinking about it.,chit-chat
for a moment after mr and mrs,novel
what was the moment after mr and mrs. for you? did you have a good time?,chit-chat
darling left the house the nightlights by the beds of the three children continued to burn clearly,novel
"wow, that must have been scary. i hope you were able to get out of the house.",chit-chat
they were awfully nice little nightlights and one can not help wishing that they could have kept awake to see peter but wendys light blinked and gave such a yawn that the other two yawned also and before they could close their mouths all the three went out,novel
"wow, that's pretty creepy. i'm glad you were able to see them.",chit-chat
there was another light in the room now a thousand times brighter than the nightlights and in the time we have taken to say this it had been in all the drawers in the nursery looking for peters shadow rummaged the wardrobe and turned every pocket inside out,novel
"wow, that's pretty scary. did you find out who it was or what happened?",chit-chat
it was not really a light it made this light by flashing about so quickly but when it came to rest for a second you saw it was a fairy no longer than your hand but still growing,novel
that's pretty cool. what did you do to make it look like it was a fairy?,chit-chat
it was a girl called tinker bell exquisitely gowned in a skeleton leaf cut low and square through which her figure could be seen to the best advantage,novel
"wow, that must have been quite an experience. did you get to see her in person?",chit-chat
she was slightly inclined to _embonpoint_,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
a moment after the fairys entrance the window was blown open by the breathing of the little stars and peter dropped in,novel
"oh wow, that's pretty cool. did you get to see any of the characters?",chit-chat
he had carried tinker bell part of the way and his hand was still messy with the fairy dust,novel
oh no! did he have to clean it up or did he just leave it in there?,chit-chat
tinker bell he called softly after making sure that the children were asleep tink where are you she was in a jug for the moment and liking it extremely she had never been in a jug before,novel
that's really nice of him to do that. i'm sure he appreciated it.,chit-chat
oh do come out of that jug and tell me do you know where they put my shadow the loveliest tinkle as of golden bells answered him,novel
i don't know where they put my shadow the loveliest tinkle as of golden bells answered him.,chit-chat
it is the fairy language,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you saying that it's a fairy language?,chit-chat
you ordinary children can never hear it but if you were to hear it you would know that you had heard it once before,novel
that's a good point. it's hard to imagine hearing something you haven't heard before.,chit-chat
tink said that the shadow was in the big box,novel
what did tink say about the shadow being in the big box? i'm not familiar with tink.,chit-chat
she meant the chest of drawers and peter jumped at the drawers scattering their contents to the floor with both hands as kings toss hapence to the crowd,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never seen a kings toss before. what's it like?,chit-chat
in a moment he had recovered his shadow and in his delight he forgot that he had shut tinker bell up in the drawer,novel
"oh my god, that's so funny! did you tell him to turn it back on?",chit-chat
if he thought at all but i dont believe he ever thought it was that he and his shadow when brought near each other would join like drops of water and when they did not he was appalled,novel
that's so sad. i'm sorry to hear that. what happened to him?,chit-chat
he tried to stick it on with soap from the bathroom but that also failed,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i've had that happen to me a few times.,chit-chat
a shudder passed through peter and he sat on the floor and cried,novel
oh no! that's terrible. i hope he's okay. what did he do?,chit-chat
his sobs woke wendy and she sat up in bed,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
she was not alarmed to see a stranger crying on the nursery floor she was only pleasantly interested,novel
"aww, that's so sweet of her. i'm sure she appreciated it.",chit-chat
boy she said courteously why are you crying peter could be exceeding polite also having learned the grand manner at fairy ceremonies and he rose and bowed to her beautifully,novel
"i'm not crying, i just don't know what to do with my life.",chit-chat
she was much pleased and bowed beautifully to him from the bed,novel
that's so nice of her. i'm sure she's proud of him.,chit-chat
whats your name he asked,novel
i don't have a name. i'm not sure if i should tell him or not.,chit-chat
wendy moira angela darling she replied with some satisfaction,novel
i've never heard of wendy moira angela darling. what does she do for fun?,chit-chat
what is your name peter pan she was already sure that he must be peter but it did seem a comparatively short name,novel
"i'm not sure if you're serious or not, but my name is peter.",chit-chat
is that all yes he said rather sharply,novel
"yes, he said he was going to do it, but he didn't want to.",chit-chat
he felt for the first time that it was a shortish name,novel
"oh, that's interesting. what was the name of the person you named it after?",chit-chat
im so sorry said wendy moira angela,novel
"it's ok, it happens to the best of us. what's your favorite character?",chit-chat
it doesnt matter peter gulped,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you saying it doesn't matter?,chit-chat
she asked where he lived,novel
that's a good question. i'm not sure if i'd want to live in a place like that.,chit-chat
second to the right said peter and then straight on till morning what a funny address peter had a sinking,novel
i didn't see that. what did peter say to the address peter had had a sinking?,chit-chat
for the first time he felt that perhaps it was a funny address,novel
that's what i'm thinking too. i think it's just a joke.,chit-chat
no it isnt he said,novel
i don't think so. i'm not sure what he's talking about.,chit-chat
i mean wendy said nicely remembering that she was hostess is that what they put on the letters he wished she had not mentioned letters,novel
"that's a good point, i didn't think of that. i guess that makes sense.",chit-chat
dont get any letters he said contemptuously,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you get some soon. what did he say?,chit-chat
but your mother gets letters dont have a mother he said,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i've never heard of that before. what is it about?,chit-chat
not only had he no mother but he had not the slightest desire to have one,novel
"oh no, i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's doing better now.",chit-chat
he thought them very overrated persons,novel
that's a shame. what did he do to make you think he was overrated?,chit-chat
wendy however felt at once that she was in the presence of a tragedy,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay. what happened to her?,chit-chat
o peter no wonder you were crying she said and got out of bed and ran to him,novel
that's what i was thinking too. i'm not sure what to do now.,chit-chat
i wasnt crying about mothers he said rather indignantly,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
i was crying because i cant get my shadow to stick on,novel
oh no! i'm sorry to hear that. are you going to get it fixed?,chit-chat
besides i wasnt crying it has come off yes then wendy saw the shadow on the floor looking so draggled and she was frightfully sorry for peter,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
how awful she said but she could not help smiling when she saw that he had been trying to stick it on with soap,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she didn't have to go through that.,chit-chat
how exactly like a boy,novel
"i don't know, i'm not sure. i've never had a boy.",chit-chat
fortunately she knew at once what to do,novel
that's true. i'm glad she didn't have to do it again.,chit-chat
it must be sewn on she said just a little patronisingly,novel
that's what i'm thinking too. i don't know what to do.,chit-chat
whats sewn he asked,novel
i don't know. i'm not sure what he's going to say.,chit-chat
youre dreadfully ignorant no im not but she was exulting in his ignorance,novel
i don't think so. i think she just doesn't know what she's talking about.,chit-chat
i shall sew it on for you my little man she said though he was tall as herself and she got out her housewife and sewed the shadow on to peters foot,novel
that's really sweet of you to do. i'm sure he'll love it.,chit-chat
i daresay it will hurt a little she warned him,novel
i don't think it will hurt at all. i'm sure he'll be fine.,chit-chat
oh i shant cry said peter who was already of the opinion that he had never cried in his life,novel
that's so sad. i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he feels better now.,chit-chat
and he clenched his teeth and did not cry and soon his shadow was behaving properly though still a little creased,novel
oh no! i hope he didn't have to go to the hospital or anything like that.,chit-chat
perhaps i should have ironed it wendy said thoughtfully but peter boylike was indifferent to appearances and he was now jumping about in the wildest glee,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a fan of boylike.",chit-chat
alas he had already forgotten that he owed his bliss to wendy,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's able to get over it.,chit-chat
he thought he had attached the shadow himself,novel
why did you think that was the case? did he think he had the shadow on him?,chit-chat
how clever i am he crowed rapturously oh the cleverness of me it is humiliating to have to confess that this conceit of peter was one of his most fascinating qualities,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
to put it with brutal frankness there never was a cockier boy,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
but for the moment wendy was shocked,novel
"i know, i was so shocked. i felt so bad for her. it was so sad.",chit-chat
you conceit she exclaimed with frightful sarcasm of course i did nothing you did a little peter said carelessly and continued to dance,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i didn't know what to do.,chit-chat
a little she replied with hauteur if i am no use i can at least withdraw and she sprang in the most dignified way into bed and covered her face with the blankets,novel
"oh my god, that's so gross! i'm so sorry to hear that.",chit-chat
to induce her to look up he pretended to be going away and when this failed he sat on the end of the bed and tapped her gently with his foot,novel
"oh my god, that's so creepy! did you find out who did it or what?",chit-chat
wendy he said dont withdraw,novel
"i don't know what that means, but i'm not sure what it means.",chit-chat
i cant help crowing wendy when im pleased with myself still she would not look up though she was listening eagerly,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
wendy he continued in a voice that no woman has ever yet been able to resist wendy one girl is more use than twenty boys now wendy was every inch a woman though there were not very many inches and she peeped out of the bedclothes,novel
"wow, that's interesting. do you know why she peeped out of the bedclothes?",chit-chat
do you really think so peter yes i do i think its perfectly sweet of you she declared and ill get up again and she sat with him on the side of the bed,novel
i don't think so at all. i'm not sure what to do with myself.,chit-chat
she also said she would give him a kiss if he liked but peter did not know what she meant and he held out his hand expectantly,novel
i didn't catch that. i'll have to rewatch it. did she say what she meant?,chit-chat
surely you know what a kiss is she asked aghast,novel
i don't know what a kiss is. i'm not sure what it is.,chit-chat
i shall know when you give it to me he replied stiffly and not to hurt his feeling she gave him a thimble,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i don't think i could do that.,chit-chat
now said he shall i give you a kiss and she replied with a slight primness if you please she made herself rather cheap by inclining her face toward him but he merely dropped an acorn button into her hand so she slowly returned her face to where it had been before and said nicely that she would wear his kiss on the chain around her neck,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i'm not sure if i'd like that.",chit-chat
it was lucky that she did put it on that chain for it was afterwards to save her life,novel
that's what i was thinking. i'm glad she was able to save her life.,chit-chat
when people in our set are introduced it is customary for them to ask each others age and so wendy who always liked to do the correct thing asked peter how old he was,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of that before. is it common where you work?,chit-chat
it was not really a happy question to ask him it was like an examination paper that asks grammar when what you want to be asked is kings of england,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to answer the question.,chit-chat
i dont know he replied uneasily but i am quite young he really knew nothing about it he had merely suspicions but he said at a venture wendy i ran away the day i was born wendy was quite surprised but interested and she indicated in the charming drawingroom manner by a touch on her nightgown that he could sit nearer her,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. i'm glad you were able to get away.",chit-chat
it was because i heard father and mother he explained in a low voice talking about what i was to be when i became a man he was extraordinarily agitated now,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
i dont want ever to be a man he said with passion,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find your passion.,chit-chat
i want always to be a little boy and to have fun,novel
that's a good attitude to have. i'm sure you'll do great.,chit-chat
so i ran away to kensington gardens and lived a long long time among the fairies she gave him a look of the most intense admiration and he thought it was because he had run away but it was really because he knew fairies,novel
that's really sweet of her. i'm sure she's very proud of you.,chit-chat
wendy had lived such a home life that to know fairies struck her as quite delightful,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you talking about the fairy fairy?,chit-chat
she poured out questions about them to his surprise for they were rather a nuisance to him getting in his way and so on and indeed he sometimes had to give them a hiding,novel
that's really nice of her. i'm glad she didn't do that to him.,chit-chat
still he liked them on the whole and he told her about the beginning of fairies,novel
that's a good point. it's hard to believe that fairy tales have been around for so long.,chit-chat
you see wendy when the first baby laughed for the first time its laugh broke into a thousand pieces and they all went skipping about and that was the beginning of fairies tedious talk this but being a stayathome she liked it,novel
that's so funny! i've never heard of this fairy tale before. what's it about?,chit-chat
and so he went on goodnaturedly there ought to be one fairy for every boy and girl ought to be,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a fan of fairy tales.",chit-chat
isnt there no,novel
i'm not sure. i've never been able to find anything about it online.,chit-chat
you see children know such a lot now they soon dont believe in fairies and every time a child says i dont believe in fairies there is a fairy somewhere that falls down dead really he thought they had now talked enough about fairies and it struck him that tinker bell was keeping very quiet,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i've never heard of a tinker bell before.",chit-chat
i cant think where she has gone to he said rising and he called tink by name,novel
that's not good. i'm sorry to hear that. what did he say?,chit-chat
wendys heart went flutter with a sudden thrill,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're feeling better now. are you okay?,chit-chat
peter she cried clutching him you dont mean to tell me that there is a fairy in this room she was here just now he said a little impatiently,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
you dont hear her do you and they both listened,novel
"no, i don't hear her at all. i'm not sure what she's up to.",chit-chat
the only sound i hear said wendy is like a tinkle of bells well thats tink thats the fairy language,novel
i've never heard that before. i'll have to try it next time i'm in a restaurant.,chit-chat
i think i hear her too the sound came from the chest of drawers and peter made a merry face,novel
"i don't know what that means, but i'm sure it's funny.",chit-chat
no one could ever look quite so merry as peter and the loveliest of gurgles was his laugh,novel
i know right! i can't believe he's such a great actor and actor.,chit-chat
he had his first laugh still,novel
that's so funny! i'm glad you were able to laugh about it. what did you laugh about?,chit-chat
wendy he whispered gleefully i do believe i shut her up in the drawer he let poor tink out of the drawer and she flew about the nursery screaming with fury,novel
"oh my god, that's terrible. i'm so sorry you had to go through that.",chit-chat
you shouldnt say such things peter retorted,novel
i don't know what to do with myself. i'm so mad at him.,chit-chat
of course im very sorry but how could i know you were in the drawer wendy was not listening to him,novel
i don't know. i was so mad at him. i felt so bad for him.,chit-chat
o peter she cried if she would only stand still and let me see her they hardly ever stand still he said but for one moment wendy saw the romantic figure come to rest on the cuckoo clock,novel
o peter she cried if she would only stand still and let me see her they hardly ever stand still he said but for one moment wendy saw the romantic figure come to rest on the cuckoo clock,chit-chat
o the lovely she cried though tinks face was still distorted with passion,novel
"i know, it's so sad. i don't know what to do with myself.",chit-chat
tink said peter amiably this lady says she wishes you were her fairy tinker bell answered insolently,novel
tink said peter amiably the lady says she wishes she were her fairy tinker bell answered insolently,chit-chat
what does she say peter he had to translate,novel
i don't know what she said. i'm not sure what she's saying.,chit-chat
she is not very polite,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do to make her feel that way?,chit-chat
she says you are a great ugly girl and that she is my fairy he tried to argue with tink,novel
"wow, that's a tough one. i'm sorry to hear that. what did he argue about?",chit-chat
you know you cant be my fairy tink because i am an gentleman and you are a lady to this tink replied in these words you silly ass and disappeared into the bathroom,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're having a good day today.,chit-chat
she is quite a common fairy peter explained apologetically she is called tinker bell because she mends the pots and kettles they were together in the armchair by this time and wendy plied him with more questions,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i didn't know that. do you have a favorite fairy?",chit-chat
if you dont live in kensington gardens now sometimes i do still but where do you live mostly now with the lost boys who are they they are the children who fall out of their perambulators when the nurse is looking the other way,novel
i live in a small town in new york city. i've never heard of kensington gardens.,chit-chat
if they are not claimed in seven days they are sent far away to the neverland to defray expenses,novel
that's a good idea. i'll have to look into that. thank you!,chit-chat
im captain what fun it must be yes said cunning peter but we are rather lonely,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what are you going to do when you're lonely?,chit-chat
you see we have no female companionship are none of the others girls oh no girls you know are much too clever to fall out of their prams this flattered wendy immensely,novel
"i don't know who wendy immensely is, but i do know she's hot.",chit-chat
i think she said it is perfectly lovely the way you talk about girls john there just despises us for reply peter rose and kicked john out of bed blankets and all one kick,novel
i don't think i've ever heard of peter rose. what's his name?,chit-chat
this seemed to wendy rather forward for a first meeting and she told him with spirit that he was not captain in her house,novel
that's interesting. what did she say to him about not being captain in her house?,chit-chat
however john continued to sleep so placidly on the floor that she allowed him to remain there,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get him some rest.,chit-chat
and i know you meant to be kind she said relenting so you may give me a kiss for the moment she had forgotten his ignorance about kisses,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i don't know if i could do that.,chit-chat
i thought you would want it back he said a little bitterly and offered to return her the thimble,novel
that's not very nice of him. did you tell him that you didn't want it back?,chit-chat
oh dear said the nice wendy i dont mean a kiss i mean a thimble whats that its like this she kissed him,novel
it's not like that at all. i don't understand what you're trying to say.,chit-chat
funny said peter gravely,novel
i've never heard of peter graven before. what does he do for a living?,chit-chat
now shall i give you a thimble if you wish to said wendy keeping her head erect this time,novel
"i don't know what that means, but i'll give you a thimble.",chit-chat
peter thimbled her and almost immediately she screeched,novel
what did peter thimbled her? i don't think i've heard of that before.,chit-chat
what is it wendy it was exactly as if someone were pulling my hair that must have been tink,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay. what did you do?,chit-chat
i never knew her so naughty before and indeed tink was darting about again using offensive language,novel
i don't think i've ever heard of tink before. who is she?,chit-chat
she says she will do that to you wendy every time i give you a thimble but why why tink again tink replied you silly ass peter could not understand why but wendy understood and she was just slightly disappointed when he admitted that he came to the nursery window not to see her but to listen to stories,novel
that's funny. i'm not sure what you're trying to say here.,chit-chat
you see i dont know any stories,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what do you like to do in your spare time?,chit-chat
none of the lost boys knows any stories how perfectly awful wendy said,novel
"i don't know much about the lost boys, but i do know that they've been around for a long time.",chit-chat
do you know peter asked why swallows build in the eaves of houses,novel
"i don't know peter, but i do know that the eaves of houses can be a lot of work.",chit-chat
it is to listen to the stories,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i like listening to the stories too.,chit-chat
o wendy your mother was telling you such a lovely story which story was it about the prince who couldnt find the lady who wore the glass slipper peter said wendy excitedly that was cinderella and he found her and they lived happily ever after peter was so glad that he rose from the floor where they had been sitting and hurried to the window,novel
that's so sweet! i've never heard of that story before. what's it about?,chit-chat
where are you going she cried with misgiving,novel
i don't know. i'm not sure what to do with myself. i feel like i've lost her.,chit-chat
to tell the other boys dont go peter she entreated i know such lots of stories those were her precise words so there can be no denying that it was she who first tempted him,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
he came back and there was a greedy look in his eyes now which ought to have alarmed her but did not,novel
that's not good. i'm sorry to hear that. what did he do?,chit-chat
oh the stories i could tell to the boys she cried and then peter gripped her and began to draw her toward the window,novel
that's so funny! i'm glad you were able to share that with them.,chit-chat
let me go she ordered him,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
wendy do come with me and tell the other boys of course she was very pleased to be asked but she said oh dear i cant,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
think of mummy,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a big fan of mummy.",chit-chat
besides i cant fly ill teach you oh how lovely to fly ill teach you how to jump on the winds back and then away we go oo she exclaimed rapturously,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. i'd love to learn how to do that.,chit-chat
wendy wendy when you are sleeping in your silly bed you might be flying about with me saying funny things to the stars oo and wendy there are mermaids mermaids,novel
"i've never seen the movie, but i know it's based on a book.",chit-chat
with tails such long tails oh cried wendy to see a mermaid he had become frightfully cunning,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you referring to the fact that wendy is a mermaid?,chit-chat
wendy he said how we should all respect you she was wriggling her body in distress,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
it was quite as if she were trying to remain on the nursery floor,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. do you think she'll get over it soon?,chit-chat
but he had no pity for her,novel
"that's true, but at least he didn't make her feel bad about it.",chit-chat
wendy he said the sly one you could tuck us in at night oo none of us has ever been tucked in at night oo and her arms went out to him,novel
that's really creepy. i'm glad he didn't do that to you.,chit-chat
and you could darn our clothes and make pockets for us,novel
what a * darn * shame.. * * * ^ ^ darn ^ ^ counter : ),chit-chat
none of us has any pockets how could she resist,novel
i don't know... i'm not sure what to do with myself.,chit-chat
of course its awfully fascinating she cried,novel
"i know, i was so shocked. i can't imagine what she must have felt like.",chit-chat
peter would you teach john and michael to fly too if you like he said indifferently and she ran to john and michael and shook them,novel
that's a good question. i'm not sure i'd want to teach them to fly.,chit-chat
wake up she cried peter pan has come and he is to teach us to fly john rubbed his eyes,novel
that's so sad. i hope you're able to get out of that situation.,chit-chat
then i shall get up he said,novel
that's a good idea. i'm sure you'll have a great time.,chit-chat
of course he was on the floor already,novel
that's what i was thinking. i'm glad he wasn't on the floor.,chit-chat
hallo he said i am up michael was up by this time also looking as sharp as a knife with six blades and a saw but peter suddenly signed silence,novel
"i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're feeling better now, michael.",chit-chat
their faces assumed the awful craftiness of children listening for sounds from the grownup world,novel
i hate when that happens. it's so annoying. i'm glad you didn't have to deal with it.,chit-chat
all was as still as salt,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're doing better now. what happened?,chit-chat
then everything was right,novel
that's what i'm saying. it's hard to believe that we've been this way for so long.,chit-chat
no stop,novel
i don't know what i'm going to do. i can't do it.,chit-chat
everything was wrong,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you have to do to make it right?,chit-chat
nana who had been barking distressfully all the evening was quiet now,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you were able to get out of the house.,chit-chat
it was her silence they had heard,novel
that's not good. i'm sorry to hear that. what did she say?,chit-chat
out with the light,novel
have you ever seen out with the light? it's an american horror film. have you seen it?,chit-chat
hide,novel
have you ever been in a situation where you felt like you had to hide from the authorities?,chit-chat
quick cried john taking command for the only time throughout the whole adventure,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get back on your feet soon.,chit-chat
and thus when liza entered holding nana the nursery seemed quite its old self very dark and you would have sworn you heard its three wicked inmates breathing angelically as they slept,novel
"wow, that's pretty intense. i'm glad you were able to get out of there.",chit-chat
they were really doing it artfully from behind the window curtains,novel
why did they do it artfully from behind the window curtains? what did you do to make it artful?,chit-chat
liza was in a bad temper for she was mixing the christmas puddings in the kitchen and had been drawn from them with a raisin still on her cheek by nanas absurd suspicions,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did liza do to deserve such a bad reaction?,chit-chat
she thought the best way of getting a little quiet was to take nana to the nursery for a moment but in custody of course,novel
that's a good idea. it's always good to have a little quiet in the house.,chit-chat
there you suspicious brute she said not sorry that nana was in disgrace,novel
"i'm not sure what you mean by that, but i don't think that's a good thing.",chit-chat
they are perfectly safe arent they,novel
"they are, but i'm not sure if they're safe for me or not.",chit-chat
every one of the little angels sound asleep in bed,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get some sleep.,chit-chat
listen to their gentle breathing here michael encouraged by his success breathed so loudly that they were nearly detected,novel
that's great! i'm glad he was able to do what he wanted to do.,chit-chat
nana knew that kind of breathing and she tried to drag herself out of lizas clutches,novel
i'm not familiar with lizas. what's it like to be in a clutches?,chit-chat
but liza was dense,novel
"i know, i was so mad at her. i felt so bad for her. it was so sad.",chit-chat
no more of it nana she said sternly pulling her out of the room,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she's able to get over it.,chit-chat
i warn you if you bark again i shall go straight for master and missus and bring them home from the party and then oh wont master whip you just she tied the unhappy dog up again but do you think nana ceased to bark,novel
i don't think that's a good idea. i'm not a dog person.,chit-chat
bring master and missus home from the party,novel
that's a good idea. i think i'm going to have to do that.,chit-chat
why that was just what she wanted,novel
"i know, i was so mad at her. i felt so bad for her and i felt bad for the rest of the family.",chit-chat
do you think she cared whether she was whipped so long as her charges were safe,novel
i don't think so. i'm not sure if she did it on purpose or not.,chit-chat
unfortunately liza returned to her puddings and nana seeing that no help would come from her strained and strained at the chain until at last she broke it,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get help.,chit-chat
in another moment she had burst into the diningroom of 27 and flung up her paws to heaven her most expressive way of making a communication,novel
"oh my god, that's the worst. i'm so sorry to hear that.",chit-chat
mr and mrs,novel
have you ever seen mr. mrs. mr? it's an american animated television series.,chit-chat
darling knew at once that something terrible was happening in their nursery and without a goodbye to their hostess they rushed into the street,novel
that's so sad. i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay.,chit-chat
but it was now ten minutes since three scoundrels had been breathing behind the curtains and peter pan can do a great deal in ten minutes,novel
"wow, that's a lot of work. i'm glad you were able to get it done.",chit-chat
we now return to the nursery,novel
that's great! i'm so happy for you. how old are you now?,chit-chat
its all right john announced emerging from his hidingplace,novel
i've never been to a hidingplace before. what's it like?,chit-chat
i say peter can you really fly instead of troubling to answer him peter flew around the room taking the mantelpiece on the way,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'll have to think about that.,chit-chat
how topping said john and michael,novel
i'm not sure what topping you're talking about. are you talking about topping john or michael?,chit-chat
how sweet cried wendy,novel
"i know, it was so sweet. i was so happy to see her in such a good mood.",chit-chat
yes im sweet oh i am sweet said peter forgetting his manners again,novel
that's good to hear. i'm sure he'll get over it soon.,chit-chat
it looked delightfully easy and they tried it first from the floor and then from the beds but they always went down instead of up,novel
that sounds like a lot of work. i'm glad you were able to do it.,chit-chat
i say how do you do it asked john rubbing his knee,novel
i don't know how to do it. i'm not very good at it.,chit-chat
he was quite a practical boy,novel
"yes, he was a very practical boy. i'm glad he's doing well now.",chit-chat
you just think lovely wonderful thoughts peter explained and they lift you up in the air he showed them again,novel
that's very true. it's nice to have someone who can relate to you.,chit-chat
youre so nippy at it john said couldnt you do it very slowly once peter did it both slowly and quickly,novel
"i think you're right, but i'm not sure if it's worth it.",chit-chat
ive got it now wendy cried john but soon he found he had not,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get through it.,chit-chat
not one of them could fly an inch though even michael was in words of two syllables and peter did not know a from z,novel
that's true. it's a shame that peter didn't know what he was talking about.,chit-chat
of course peter had been trifling with them for no one can fly unless the fairy dust has been blown on him,novel
that's what i was thinking. i'm glad he didn't do it.,chit-chat
fortunately as we have mentioned one of his hands was messy with it and he blew some on each of them with the most superb results,novel
that's good to hear. i'm glad he's doing well for himself.,chit-chat
now just wiggle your shoulders this way he said and let go they were all on their beds and gallant michael let go first,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i think i'll do that.,chit-chat
he did not quite mean to let go but he did it and immediately he was borne across the room,novel
that's not good. i'm sorry to hear that. what did he do?,chit-chat
i flewed he screamed while still in midair,novel
oh no! what did you do? did you tell him to get out of the way?,chit-chat
john let go and met wendy near the bathroom,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never met wendy. what did she look like?,chit-chat
oh lovely oh ripping look at me look at me look at me they were not nearly so elegant as peter they could not help kicking a little but their heads were bobbing against the ceiling and there is almost nothing so delicious as that,novel
that's so funny! i'm glad you enjoyed it. do you have a favorite food?,chit-chat
peter gave wendy a hand at first but had to desist tink was so indignant,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i didn't see it coming.,chit-chat
up and down they went and round and round,novel
up and down they went and round and round... that's a great song.,chit-chat
heavenly was wendys word,novel
i've always wanted to go to heavenly place. it's a place in new york city.,chit-chat
i say cried john why shouldnt we all go out of course it was to this that peter had been luring them,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
michael was ready he wanted to see how long it took him to do a billion miles,novel
"wow, that's a lot of miles. he must have been very proud of him.",chit-chat
but wendy hesitated,novel
i don't think i've ever seen that movie. what's it about?,chit-chat
mermaids said peter again,novel
i've never seen a mermaids movie. what's the name of the mermaid?,chit-chat
oo and there are pirates pirates cried john seizing his sunday hat let us go at once it was just at this moment that mr and mrs,novel
that's so sad. i'm sorry you had to go through that. i hope you're feeling better now.,chit-chat
darling hurried with nana out of 27,novel
darling rushed with nana out of 27 out of 28. that's a lot of hits!,chit-chat
they ran into the middle of the street to look up at the nursery window and yes it was still shut but the room was ablaze with light and most heartgripping sight of all they could see in shadow on the curtain three little figures in night attire circling round and round not on the floor but in the air,novel
"wow, that's scary! i'm glad you were able to sleep at night.",chit-chat
not three figures four,novel
have you ever been to a three figures four concert? it's a lot of fun.,chit-chat
in a tremble they opened the street door,novel
"wow, that's pretty scary. what did they do to make you think they were going to do that?",chit-chat
mr,novel
have you ever heard of mr. robot? it's a tv series based on mr. mr. universe.,chit-chat
darling would have rushed upstairs but mrs,novel
"darling would have rushed upstairs, mrs. mrs. would have done the same. i'm not sure i would have liked that.",chit-chat
darling signed him to go softly,novel
that's awesome! i'm so happy for him. he's such a great player.,chit-chat
she even tried to make her heart go softly,novel
what did she do to make her heart go so soft? i don't get it.,chit-chat
will they reach the nursery in time,novel
i think they will. it's been a long time since i've seen them.,chit-chat
if so how delightful for them and we shall all breathe a sigh of relief but there will be no story,novel
i'm so happy for them. i can't wait to see what they come up with.,chit-chat
on the other hand if they are not in time i solemnly promise that it will all come right in the end,novel
that's a good attitude to have. i'm sure you'll be fine.,chit-chat
they would have reached the nursery in time had it not been that the little stars were watching them,novel
they would have reached the nursery in time had it not been that the little stars were watching them.,chit-chat
once again the stars blew the window open and that smallest star of all called out cave peter then peter knew that there was not a moment to lose,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never seen a cave peter before. what's the name of the cave peter?,chit-chat
come he cried imperiously and soared out at once into the night followed by john and michael and wendy,novel
"wow, that must have been quite the experience. did you have a good time with him?",chit-chat
mr and mrs,novel
have you ever seen mr. mrs. mr? it's an american animated television series.,chit-chat
darling and nana rushed into the nursery too late,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. do you have any plans for the next few days?,chit-chat
the birds were flown,novel
that's awesome! i'm so happy for you! do you have any plans for the weekend?,chit-chat
chapter iv,novel
"do you like to read? i've been reading a lot of manga lately, and i'm really enjoying it.",chit-chat
the flight second to the right and straight on till morning that peter had told wendy was the way to the neverland but even birds carrying maps and consulting them at windy corners could not have sighted it with these instructions,novel
"wow, that's amazing! i've always wanted to go to the neverland.",chit-chat
peter you see just said anything that came into his head,novel
what did he say? i'm not familiar with peter. what came into his head?,chit-chat
at first his companions trusted him implicitly and so great were the delights of flying that they wasted time circling round church spires or any other tall objects on the way that took their fancy,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. i've never heard of that before. what happened?",chit-chat
john and michael raced michael getting a start,novel
that's good to hear. i'm a big fan of michael and john racing.,chit-chat
they recalled with contempt that not so long ago they had thought themselves fine fellows for being able to fly round a room,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get back on your feet soon.,chit-chat
not long ago,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're doing better now. what happened?,chit-chat
but how long ago,novel
it was a long time ago. i'm not sure how long it's been.,chit-chat
they were flying over the sea before this thought began to disturb wendy seriously,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay. what did they do?,chit-chat
john thought it was their second sea and their third night,novel
john thought it was their second sea and the third night? what did he think it was?,chit-chat
sometimes it was dark and sometimes light and now they were very cold and again too warm,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad it's not just me.,chit-chat
did they really feel hungry at times or were they merely pretending because peter had such a jolly new way of feeding them,novel
i don't think they felt hungry at all. i think they were just trying to make me feel better.,chit-chat
his way was to pursue birds who had food in their mouths suitable for humans and snatch it from them then the birds would follow and snatch it back and they would all go chasing each other gaily for miles parting at last with mutual expressions of goodwill,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i've never heard of a bird like that before.",chit-chat
but wendy noticed with gentle concern that peter did not seem to know that this was rather an odd way of getting your bread and butter nor even that there are other ways,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think of that. i'll have to think about that.,chit-chat
certainly they did not pretend to be sleepy they were sleepy and that was a danger for the moment they popped off down they fell,novel
that's what i was thinking. it's hard to believe they didn't do anything.,chit-chat
the awful thing was that peter thought this funny,novel
what did he think was funny? i'm not familiar with peter. what was it?,chit-chat
there he goes again he would cry gleefully as michael suddenly dropped like a stone,novel
"haha, that's a good one. i can't wait to see what he's going to do next.",chit-chat
save him save him cried wendy looking with horror at the cruel sea far below,novel
i'm not sure if i could do that. i don't think i could.,chit-chat
eventually peter would dive through the air and catch michael just before he could strike the sea and it was lovely the way he did it but he always waited till the last moment and you felt it was his cleverness that interested him and not the saving of human life,novel
that's really sweet of him. i'm glad he's doing well now.,chit-chat
also he was fond of variety and the sport that engrossed him one moment would suddenly cease to engage him so there was always the possibility that the next time you fell he would let you go,novel
that's a great way to look at it. i'm glad you were able to get away from him.,chit-chat
he could sleep in the air without falling by merely lying on his back and floating but this was partly at least because he was so light that if you got behind him and blew he went faster,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad he was able to sleep in the air.,chit-chat
do be more polite to him wendy whispered to john when they were playing follow my leader then tell him to stop showing off said john,novel
that's a good idea. i'm going to try that next time i see him.,chit-chat
when playing follow my leader peter would fly close to the water and touch each sharks tail in passing just as in the street you may run your finger along an iron railing,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun! what kind of sharks do you have in your area?,chit-chat
they could not follow him in this with much success so perhaps it was rather like showing off especially as he kept looking behind to see how many tails they missed,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think of that. i'll have to try that next time.,chit-chat
you must be nice to him wendy impressed on her brothers,novel
i'm not sure if he's impressed or not. i don't know what to do with myself.,chit-chat
what could we do if he were to leave us we could go back michael said,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure how he would feel about that.,chit-chat
how could we ever find our way back without him well then we could go on said john,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're doing better now that he's gone.,chit-chat
that is the awful thing john,novel
"i know, it's so gross. i don't know what i'm going to do about it.",chit-chat
we should have to go on for we dont know how to stop this was true peter had forgotten to show them how to stop,novel
i don't know how to stop it. i'm not sure what to do.,chit-chat
john said that if the worst came to the worst all they had to do was to go straight on for the world was round and so in time they must come back to their own window,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm not sure i could do that.,chit-chat
and who is to get food for us john i nipped a bit out of that eagles mouth pretty neatly wendy after the twentieth try wendy reminded him,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get some food for him.,chit-chat
and even though we became good at picking up food see how we bump against clouds and things if he is not near to give us a hand indeed they were constantly bumping,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm not sure i could do that.,chit-chat
they could now fly strongly though they still kicked far too much but if they saw a cloud in front of them the more they tried to avoid it the more certainly did they bump into it,novel
"that's a good point, i didn't think of that. i'll have to try that.",chit-chat
if nana had been with them she would have had a bandage round michaels forehead by this time,novel
i don't think so. i think it would have been a lot worse if nana had been with them.,chit-chat
peter was not with them for the moment and they felt rather lonely up there by themselves,novel
peter was not with them for the moment and they felt rather lonely up there by themselves...,chit-chat
he could go so much faster than they that he would suddenly shoot out of sight to have some adventure in which they had no share,novel
he could go so much faster than they that he would suddenly shoot out of sight to have some adventure in which they had no share,chit-chat
he would come down laughing over something fearfully funny he had been saying to a star but he had already forgotten what it was or he would come up with mermaid scales still sticking to him and yet not be able to say for certain what had been happening,novel
"oh my gosh, that's so funny! i've had that happen to me before.",chit-chat
it was really rather irritating to children who had never seen a mermaid,novel
oh no! i'm sorry to hear that. i've never seen a mermaid either.,chit-chat
and if he forgets them so quickly wendy argued how can we expect that he will go on remembering us indeed sometimes when he returned he did not remember them at least not well,novel
that's a good point. i don't know if he'll remember them.,chit-chat
wendy was sure of it,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you referring to the fact that wendy was sure of it?,chit-chat
she saw recognition come into his eyes as he was about to pass them the time of day and go on once even she had to call him by name,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never seen that happen before. what did she do?,chit-chat
im wendy she said agitatedly,novel
"what did she say? i've never heard of agitatedly, but i'm familiar with it.",chit-chat
he was very sorry,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did he do to make you feel that way?,chit-chat
i say wendy he whispered to her always if you see me forgetting you just keep on saying im wendy and then ill remember of course this was rather unsatisfactory,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
however to make amends he showed them how to lie out flat on a strong wind that was going their way and this was such a pleasant change that they tried it several times and found that they could sleep thus with security,novel
that's really nice of him to do that for you. i'm glad it worked out for them.,chit-chat
indeed they would have slept longer but peter tired quickly of sleeping and soon he would cry in his captain voice we get off here so with occasional tiffs but on the whole rollicking they drew near the neverland for after many moons they did reach it and what is more they had been going pretty straight all the time not perhaps so much owing to the guidance of peter or tink as because the island was looking for them,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. i've never heard of an island like that before.",chit-chat
it is only thus that any one may sight those magic shores,novel
"that's true, but i'm not sure if i'll ever be able to do it.",chit-chat
there it is said peter calmly,novel
oh really? i didn't know that. i'll have to check it out.,chit-chat
where where where all the arrows are pointing indeed a million golden arrows were pointing it out to the children all directed by their friend the sun who wanted them to be sure of their way before leaving them for the night,novel
"wow, that's a lot of gold! i've never heard of the sun wanting to be sure of their way before leaving them for the night.",chit-chat
wendy and john and michael stood on tiptoe in the air to get their first sight of the island,novel
"hi, how are you today? i just got back from a trip to the island. it's a beautiful place.",chit-chat
strange to say they all recognized it at once and until fear fell upon them they hailed it not as something long dreamt of and seen at last but as a familiar friend to whom they were returning home for the holidays,novel
that's a good way to look at it. it's very strange to think about.,chit-chat
john theres the lagoon wendy look at the turtles burying their eggs in the sand i say john i see your flamingo with the broken leg look michael theres your cave john whats that in the brushwood its a wolf with her whelps,novel
i've never heard of a flamingo before. do you have a name for them?,chit-chat
wendy i do believe thats your little whelp theres my boat john with her sides stove in no it isnt,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope it's not your little whelp.,chit-chat
why we burned your boat thats her at any rate,novel
"i don't know why we burned your boat, but i do know why she did it.",chit-chat
i say john i see the smoke of the redskin camp where,novel
"i've never been to the redskin camp, but i'm familiar with it. what's it like?",chit-chat
show me and ill tell you by the way smoke curls whether they are on the warpath there just across the mysterious river i see now,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of that before. what's it like?,chit-chat
yes they are on the warpath right enough peter was a little annoyed with them for knowing so much but if he wanted to lord it over them his triumph was at hand for have i not told you that anon fear fell upon them,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think of it that way. it makes sense.,chit-chat
it came as the arrows went leaving the island in gloom,novel
"oh wow, that's pretty cool. what did you do to get the arrow out?",chit-chat
in the old days at home the neverland had always begun to look a little dark and threatening by bedtime,novel
that must have been scary. what did you do to scare the neverland away from you?,chit-chat
then unexplored patches arose in it and spread black shadows moved about in them the roar of the beasts of prey was quite different now and above all you lost the certainty that you would win,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. what do you like to do in your free time?,chit-chat
you were quite glad that the nightlights were on,novel
"yes, i was. i was so scared of the night lights. i didn't know what to expect.",chit-chat
you even liked nana to say that this was just the mantelpiece over here and that the neverland was all makebelieve,novel
i'm not familiar with the neverland. what's it about? i've never heard of it.,chit-chat
of course the neverland had been makebelieve in those days but it was real now and there were no nightlights and it was getting darker every moment and where was nana,novel
that's a good point. it's hard to believe that the neverland has been around for so long.,chit-chat
they had been flying apart but they huddled close to peter now,novel
that's so sad. i'm sorry to hear that. i hope they're okay.,chit-chat
his careless manner had gone at last his eyes were sparkling and a tingle went through them every time they touched his body,novel
oh no! that's terrible. i hope he's okay. i'm sorry to hear that.,chit-chat
they were now over the fearsome island flying so low that sometimes a tree grazed their feet,novel
"wow, that must have been scary. what did you do to make it up to them?",chit-chat
nothing horrid was visible in the air yet their progress had become slow and laboured exactly as if they were pushing their way through hostile forces,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get back on your feet soon.,chit-chat
sometimes they hung in the air until peter had beaten on it with his fists,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of that before. do you have a source for that?,chit-chat
they dont want us to land he explained,novel
that's too bad. i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to land soon.,chit-chat
who are they wendy whispered shuddering,novel
"i'm not sure, but i do know that they've been around for a long time.",chit-chat
but he could not or would not say,novel
that's what i was thinking. it's hard to say no to something you love.,chit-chat
tinker bell had been asleep on his shoulder but now he wakened her and sent her on in front,novel
"wow, that's pretty crazy. did he end up doing something to make her feel better?",chit-chat
sometimes he poised himself in the air listening intently with his hand to his ear and again he would stare down with eyes so bright that they seemed to bore two holes to earth,novel
"oh my god, that's the worst! i've had that happen to me before.",chit-chat
having done these things he went on again,novel
that's good to hear. how long did it take for him to do it again?,chit-chat
his courage was almost appalling,novel
i know right? i can't even imagine what it must have been like to be in that situation.,chit-chat
would you like an adventure now he said casually to john or would you like to have your tea first wendy said tea first quickly and michael pressed her hand in gratitude but the braver john hesitated,novel
i would like to have my tea first and michael pressed her hand in gratitude but the braver john hesitated,chit-chat
what kind of adventure he asked cautiously,novel
"he said he wanted to go on a cruise, but i don't know what to do.",chit-chat
theres a pirate asleep in the pampas just beneath us peter told him,novel
oh no! i hope he's okay. i've never seen a pirate sleep in the pampas.,chit-chat
if you like well go down and kill him i dont see him john said after a long pause,novel
that's a good idea. i'll have to do that. thanks for the advice.,chit-chat
i do suppose john said a little huskily he were to wake up peter spoke indignantly,novel
"i don't think so. i think it was more of a "" i'm going to die "" kind of thing.",chit-chat
you dont think i would kill him while he was sleeping,novel
i don't think i would either. i'm not sure i could do that.,chit-chat
i would wake him first and then kill him,novel
that's a good plan. i'm not sure if i could do that though.,chit-chat
thats the way i always do i say,novel
that's the way i always do too. i think it's a good thing.,chit-chat
do you kill many tons john said how ripping but decided to have tea first,novel
"no, i don't kill tons of people. i'm more of a tea drinker.",chit-chat
he asked if there were many pirates on the island just now and peter said he had never known so many,novel

i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
oh lovely perhaps she is going to sing in her sleep said peter,novel
that's a great idea! i'm sure she'll have a great time.,chit-chat
wendy sing the kind of house you would like to have immediately without opening her eyes wendy began to sing i wish i had a pretty house the littlest ever seen with funny little red walls and roof of mossy green they gurgled with joy at this for by the greatest good luck the branches they had brought were sticky with red sap and all the ground was carpeted with moss,novel
"wow, that's pretty cool. i've never seen a house like that before.",chit-chat
as they rattled up the little house they broke into song themselves weve built the little walls and roof and made a lovely door so tell us mother wendy what are you wanting more to this she answered greedily oh really next i think ill have gay windows all about with roses peeping in you know and babies peeping out with a blow of their fists they made windows and large yellow leaves were the blinds,novel
"wow, that's a long story. i don't think i've heard that before.",chit-chat
but roses,novel
"i love roses, they are my favorite flower of all time. do you have a favorite flower?",chit-chat
roses cried peter sternly,novel
"roses cried peter stereodo, which is a fictional character from a tv show called roses.",chit-chat
quickly they madebelieve to grow the loveliest roses up the walls,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i don't think i could do that.,chit-chat
babies,novel
have you ever been to a zoo? it's a place where animals are kept as pets.,chit-chat
to prevent peter ordering babies they hurried into song again weve made the roses peeping out the babes are at the door we can not make ourselves you know cos weve been made before peter seeing this to be a good idea at once pretended that it was his own,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. i didn't know that. do you have a favorite song?",chit-chat
the house was quite beautiful and no doubt wendy was very cosy within though of course they could no longer see her,novel
i'm glad you got to see her. i've never seen a house like that before.,chit-chat
peter strode up and down ordering finishing touches,novel
"peter stared down, down ordering finishing touches... i'm not sure what that means.",chit-chat
nothing escaped his eagle eyes,novel
what did he look like? i don't think i've ever seen a bird with eagle eyes.,chit-chat
just when it seemed absolutely finished theres no knocker on the door he said,novel
i hate when that happens. i hope it wasn't a big deal. what did you do?,chit-chat
they were very ashamed but tootles gave the sole of his shoe and it made an excellent knocker,novel
that's so funny! i've never heard of tootles before. who is he?,chit-chat
absolutely finished now they thought,novel
that's awesome! i'm so happy for you. i hope you have a great day!,chit-chat
not of bit of it,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you saying you don't like it?,chit-chat
theres no chimney peter said we must have a chimney it certainly does need a chimney said john importantly,novel
"i've never heard of a chimney, but i'll look into it. thanks for the heads up!",chit-chat
this gave peter an idea,novel
that's cool. what kind of idea was it? i'm not familiar with peter.,chit-chat
he snatched the hat off johns head knocked out the bottom and put the hat on the roof,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad he didn't have to put it on the roof.,chit-chat
the little house was so pleased to have such a capital chimney that as if to say thank you smoke immediately began to come out of the hat,novel
that's so nice of them. i'm glad you were able to enjoy it.,chit-chat
now really and truly it was finished,novel
"yes, i'm so proud of him. he's such a joy to watch.",chit-chat
nothing remained to do but to knock,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do to get out of the house?,chit-chat
all look your best peter warned them first impressions are awfully important he was glad no one asked him what first impressions are they were all too busy looking their best,novel
that's a good way to look at it. it's always good to have a first impression.,chit-chat
he knocked politely and now the wood was as still as the children not a sound to be heard except from tinker bell who was watching from a branch and openly sneering,novel
"wow, that's pretty cool. i'm glad he didn't get hurt.",chit-chat
what the boys were wondering was would any one answer the knock,novel
what the boys were wondering was would any one answer the knock? what was the knock about?,chit-chat
if a lady what would she be like,novel
i don't know... i'm not sure i would want to be a lady.,chit-chat
the door opened and a lady came out,novel
that's pretty cool. what did she do? did you tell her to get out?,chit-chat
it was wendy,novel
that's a good one. i've never heard of it before. what's it about?,chit-chat
they all whipped off their hats,novel
that's what i'm thinking. i don't know what to do with myself.,chit-chat
she looked properly surprised and this was just how they had hoped she would look,novel
that's a good way to look at it. it's always nice to be surprised.,chit-chat
where am i she said,novel
"i don't know where you are, but i'm sure you'll find out soon enough.",chit-chat
of course slightly was the first to get his word in,novel
that's what i was thinking. i'm glad he was able to get his word in.,chit-chat
wendy lady he said rapidly for you we built this house oh say youre pleased cried nibs,novel
i've never heard of wendy lady. what does she do for a living? do you have a job?,chit-chat
lovely darling house wendy said and they were the very words they had hoped she would say,novel
i'm glad to hear that. it's always good to hear from someone who knows what they're talking about.,chit-chat
and we are your children cried the twins,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. how old are your children? do you have any siblings?,chit-chat
then all went on their knees and holding out their arms cried o wendy lady be our mother ought i wendy said all shining,novel
that's so sad. i'm sorry you had to go through that. i hope you feel better.,chit-chat
of course its frightfully fascinating but you see i am only a little girl,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. do you have any siblings that you can talk to about it?,chit-chat
i have no real experience that doesnt matter said peter as if he were the only person present who knew all about it though he was really the one who knew least,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i don't think i've met anyone like that before.,chit-chat
what we need is just a nice motherly person oh dear wendy said you see i feel that is exactly what i am it is it is they all cried we saw it at once very well she said i will do my best,novel
that's a good attitude to have. i'm sure you'll do great!,chit-chat
come inside at once you naughty children i am sure your feet are damp,novel
"i don't think i could do that. i'm not a naughty child, lol.",chit-chat
and before i put you to bed i have just time to finish the story of cinderella in they went i dont know how there was room for them but you can squeeze very tight in the neverland,novel
i've never heard of the neverland. what's it about? do you like it?,chit-chat
and that was the first of the many joyous evenings they had with wendy,novel
i'm not sure i've ever heard of wendy. what's it about?,chit-chat
by and by she tucked them up in the great bed in the home under the trees but she herself slept that night in the little house and peter kept watch outside with drawn sword for the pirates could be heard carousing far away and the wolves were on the prowl,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i'm not familiar with the story, but it sounds interesting.",chit-chat
the little house looked so cosy and safe in the darkness with a bright light showing through its blinds and the chimney smoking beautifully and peter standing on guard,novel
that's so cool! i've never seen a house like that before. i'm glad it was safe.,chit-chat
after a time he fell asleep and some unsteady fairies had to climb over him on their way home from an orgy,novel
"wow, that must have been a scary experience for you. did you find out who it was?",chit-chat
any of the other boys obstructing the fairy path at night they would have mischiefed but they just tweaked peters nose and passed on,novel
"oh my god, that's terrible. i'm sorry you had to go through that.",chit-chat
chapter vii,novel
i'm a big fan of chapter chapter. it's one of my favorite novels.,chit-chat
the home under the ground one of the first things peter did next day was to measure wendy and john and michael for hollow trees,novel
"wow, that's impressive. i've never seen a home under the ground before.",chit-chat
hook you remember had sneered at the boys for thinking they needed a tree apiece but this was ignorance for unless your tree fitted you it was difficult to go up and down and no two of the boys were quite the same size,novel
that's terrible. i'm sorry you had to go through that. i hope you're doing better now.,chit-chat
once you fitted you drew in your breath at the top and down you went at exactly the right speed while to ascend you drew in and let out alternately and so wriggled up,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun! i'm glad you didn't get hurt.,chit-chat
of course when you have mastered the action you are able to do these things without thinking of them and nothing can be more graceful,novel
that's true. it's a good feeling to be able to do those things.,chit-chat
but you simply must fit and peter measures you for your tree as carefully as for a suit of clothes the only difference being that the clothes are made to fit you while you have to be made to fit the tree,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure i could fit in a suit though.,chit-chat
usually it is done quite easily as by your wearing too many garments or too few but if you are bumpy in awkward places or the only available tree is an odd shape peter does some things to you and after that you fit,novel
that's a good idea. i'll have to try that. thanks for the advice!,chit-chat
once you fit great care must be taken to go on fitting and this as wendy was to discover to her delight keeps a whole family in perfect condition,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad she found out.,chit-chat
wendy and michael fitted their trees at the first try but john had to be altered a little,novel
"i've never seen the movie, but i hear it's really good. did you like it?",chit-chat
after a few days practice they could go up and down as gaily as buckets in a well,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'll have to try that.,chit-chat
and how ardently they grew to love their home under the ground especially wendy,novel
that's a good question. i'm not sure how they grew to love their home under the ground.,chit-chat
it consisted of one large room as all houses should do with a floor in which you could dig if you wanted to go fishing and in this floor grew stout mushrooms of a charming colour which were used as stools,novel
"wow, that sounds like a lot of fun. did you ever find out who did it?",chit-chat
a never tree tried hard to grow in the centre of the room but every morning they sawed the trunk through level with the floor,novel
"wow, that's impressive. i've never heard of a never tree. what kind of tree is it?",chit-chat
by teatime it was always about two feet high and then they put a door on top of it the whole thus becoming a table as soon as they cleared away they sawed off the trunk again and thus there was more room to play,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i've never heard of that before, but it sounds interesting.",chit-chat
there was an enormous fireplace which was in almost any part of the room where you cared to light it and across this wendy stretched strings made of fibre from which she suspended her washing,novel
"wow, that must have been scary! did you find out who did it or did you just assume it was her?",chit-chat
the bed was tilted against the wall by day and let down at 630 when it filled nearly half the room and all the boys slept in it except michael lying like sardines in a tin,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get it fixed.,chit-chat
there was a strict rule against turning round until one gave the signal when all turned at once,novel
that's not good. i hate when people do that. it's so annoying.,chit-chat
michael should have used it also but wendy would have a baby and he was the littlest and you know what women are and the short and long of it is that he was hung up in a basket,novel
"he should have used it, but he didn't. he was the only one who could use it.",chit-chat
it was rough and simple and not unlike what baby bears would have made of an underground house in the same circumstances,novel
i'm sorry you had to go through that. i hope you're doing better now.,chit-chat
but there was one recess in the wall no larger than a birdcage which was the private apartment of tinker bell,novel
that's interesting. did you find out who it was? i've never heard of tinker bell.,chit-chat
it could be shut off from the rest of the house by a tiny curtain which tink who was most fastidious always kept drawn when dressing or undressing,novel
"that's a good idea, i'll have to look into that. i've never heard of a tink like that before.",chit-chat
no woman however large could have had a more exquisite boudoir and bedchamber combined,novel
"i've never been to a bedchamber, but i'd love to go one day.",chit-chat
the couch as she always called it was a genuine queen mab with club legs and she varied the bedspreads according to what fruitblossom was in season,novel
that's so cool! i've never seen a couch like that before. what did she use it for?,chit-chat
her mirror was a pussinboots of which there are now only three unchipped known to fairy dealers the washstand was piecrust and reversible the chest of drawers an authentic charming the sixth and the carpet and rugs the best the early period of margery and robin,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i've never heard of a pussinboots before.",chit-chat
there was a chandelier from tiddlywinks for the look of the thing but of course she lit the residence herself,novel
"oh wow, that's crazy! did you find out who it was or did you just assume it was a chandelier?",chit-chat
tink was very contemptuous of the rest of the house as indeed was perhaps inevitable and her chamber though beautiful looked rather conceited having the appearance of a nose permanently turned up,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get it fixed.,chit-chat
i suppose it was all especially entrancing to wendy because those rampagious boys of hers gave her so much to do,novel
"that's a good point. i didn't think of that, but you're right.",chit-chat
really there were whole weeks when except perhaps with a stocking in the evening she was never above ground,novel
"i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she's doing better now, though.",chit-chat
the cooking i can tell you kept her nose to the pot and even if there was nothing in it even if there was no pot she had to keep watching that it came aboil just the same,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i don't know why i didn't think of that.,chit-chat
you never exactly knew whether there would be a real meal or just a makebelieve it all depended upon peters whim he could eat really eat if it was part of a game but he could not stodge just to feel stodgy which is what most children like better than anything else the next best thing being to talk about it,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad you were able to talk to him about it.,chit-chat
makebelieve was so real to him that during a meal of it you could see him getting rounder,novel
i can't wait to see what he does next. i hope he's doing well.,chit-chat
of course it was trying but you simply had to follow his lead and if you could prove to him that you were getting loose for your tree he let you stodge,novel
that's a good point. i'll have to do that next time i see him.,chit-chat
wendys favourite time for sewing and darning was after they had all gone to bed,novel
i love sewing and darning! it's such a great way to relax and relax.,chit-chat
then as she expressed it she had a breathing time for herself and she occupied it in making new things for them and putting double pieces on the knees for they were all most frightfully hard on their knees,novel
that's so sweet of her. i'm glad she was able to do that for herself.,chit-chat
when she sat down to a basketful of their stockings every heel with a hole in it she would fling up her arms and exclaim oh dear i am sure i sometimes think spinsters are to be envied her face beamed when she exclaimed this,novel
"oh my god, i can't even imagine what you're going through right now.",chit-chat
you remember about her pet wolf,novel
"no, i don't. what happened to it? i'm not familiar with it.",chit-chat
well it very soon discovered that she had come to the island and it found her out and they just ran into each others arms,novel
oh no! that's so scary! i'm so sorry you had to go through that.,chit-chat
after that it followed her about everywhere,novel
that's what i was thinking. i can't imagine what that must have been like.,chit-chat
as time wore on did she think much about the beloved parents she had left behind her,novel
i don't think so. i'm not sure why she left her parents behind.,chit-chat
this is a difficult question because it is quite impossible to say how time does wear on in the neverland where it is calculated by moons and suns and there are ever so many more of them than on the mainland,novel
that's a good point. it's hard to say how long it takes for the sun to set.,chit-chat
but i am afraid that wendy did not really worry about her father and mother she was absolutely confident that they would always keep the window open for her to fly back by and this gave her complete ease of mind,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure why she didn't think of that.,chit-chat
what did disturb her at times was that john remembered his parents vaguely only as people he had once known while michael was quite willing to believe that she was really his mother,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think of that. i think it's interesting that he was able to remember his parents from a very young age.,chit-chat
these things scared her a little and nobly anxious to do her duty she tried to fix the old life in their minds by setting them examination papers on it as like as possible to the ones she used to do at school,novel
that's really sweet of her. i'm glad she's doing better now.,chit-chat
the other boys thought this awfully interesting and insisted on joining and they made slates for themselves and sat round the table writing and thinking hard about the questions she had written on another slate and passed round,novel
that's terrible. i'm sorry you had to go through that. what did you do?,chit-chat
they were the most ordinary questionswhat was the colour of mothers eyes,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you talking about the color of the eyes?,chit-chat
which was taller father or mother,novel
"i'm taller than both of them, so i think it's a mix of both.",chit-chat
was mother blonde or brunette,novel
"i think it was a brunette, but i'm not sure. i don't know much about brunettes.",chit-chat
answer all three questions if possible a write an essay of not less than 40 words on how i spent my last holidays or the characters of father and mother compared,novel
that's a lot of words. how did you spend your last holidays? did you have a good time?,chit-chat
only one of these to be attempted or 1 describe mothers laugh 2 describe fathers laugh 3 describe mothers party dress 4 describe the kennel and its inmate they were just everyday questions like these and when you could not answer them you were told to make a cross and it was really dreadful what a number of crosses even john made,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. i've never heard of any of these before.",chit-chat
of course the only boy who replied to every question was slightly and no one could have been more hopeful of coming out first but his answers were perfectly ridiculous and he really came out last a melancholy thing,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. it's always good to be prepared for situations like that.,chit-chat
peter did not compete,novel
i am sorry to hear that. i hope you are able to get out of the house soon.,chit-chat
for one thing he despised all mothers except wendy and for another he was the only boy on the island who could neither write nor spell not the smallest word,novel
"wow, that's interesting. what did he do to despise all mothers except wendy?",chit-chat
he was above all that sort of thing,novel
that's what i'm thinking. i don't know what to do with myself.,chit-chat
by the way the questions were all written in the past tense,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i didn't think about that.,chit-chat
what was the colour of mothers eyes and so on,novel
"i'm not sure, but i do know that my mother's eyes are blue.",chit-chat
wendy you see had been forgetting too,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you referring to a person or a person?,chit-chat
adventures of course as we shall see were of daily occurrence but about this time peter invented with wendys help a new game that fascinated him enormously until he suddenly had no more interest in it which as you have been told was what always happened with his games,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of this game before. what's it about?,chit-chat
it consisted in pretending not to have adventures in doing the sort of thing john and michael had been doing all their lives sitting on stools flinging balls in the air pushing each other going out for walks and coming back without having killed so much as a grizzly,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun! i'll have to give it a try sometime.,chit-chat
to see peter doing nothing on a stool was a great sight he could not help looking solemn at such times to sit still seemed to him such a comic thing to do,novel
i can't wait to see what he does on the stool. i'm sure it's a lot of fun.,chit-chat
he boasted that he had gone walking for the good of his health,novel
that's not good. i'm sorry to hear that. what did he do?,chit-chat
for several suns these were the most novel of all adventures to him and john and michael had to pretend to be delighted also otherwise he would have treated them severely,novel
that's really interesting. i'm not familiar with the suns. what was it about?,chit-chat
he often went out alone and when he came back you were never absolutely certain whether he had had an adventure or not,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad you were able to find him.,chit-chat
he might have forgotten it so completely that he said nothing about it and then when you went out you found the body and on the other hand he might say a great deal about it and yet you could not find the body,novel
that's what i'm thinking too. i don't know what to do now.,chit-chat
sometimes he came home with his head bandaged and then wendy cooed over him and bathed it in lukewarm water while he told a dazzling tale,novel
"wow, that's pretty wild. i've never heard of a dazzling tale before.",chit-chat
but she was never quite sure you know,novel
"that's true, but i'm not sure if i should tell her. i don't want to hurt her feelings.",chit-chat
there were however many adventures which she knew to be true because she was in them herself and there were still more that were at least partly true for the other boys were in them and said they were wholly true,novel
that's interesting. did you ever find out who she was or what she was up to?,chit-chat
to describe them all would require a book as large as an englishlatin latinenglish dictionary and the most we can do is to give one as a specimen of an average hour on the island,novel
that sounds like a lot of work. i'm not sure i'd be able to do it.,chit-chat
the difficulty is which one to choose,novel
i don't know. i'm trying to figure out what to do with my life.,chit-chat
should we take the brush with the redskins at slightly gulch,novel
i'm not familiar with the redskins. what is it about them you're talking about?,chit-chat
it was a sanguinary affair and especially interesting as showing one of peters peculiarities which was that in the middle of a fight he would suddenly change sides,novel
that sounds like a very interesting affair. what did you do to make him change his mind?,chit-chat
at the gulch when victory was still in the balance sometimes leaning this way and sometimes that he called out im redskin today what are you tootles and tootles answered redskin what are you nibs and nibs said redskin what are you twin and so on and they were all redskins and of course this would have ended the fight had not the real redskins fascinated by peters methods agreed to be lost boys for that once and so at it they all went again more fiercely than ever,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. i've never heard of the gulch before.",chit-chat
the extraordinary upshot of this adventure wasbut we have not decided yet that this is the adventure we are to narrate,novel
what is the adventure we are to narrate? i've never heard of it before.,chit-chat
perhaps a better one would be the night attack by the redskins on the house under the ground when several of them stuck in the hollow trees and had to be pulled out like corks,novel
i've never heard of that one. i'll have to look it up. what's it about?,chit-chat
or we might tell how peter saved tiger lilys life in the mermaids lagoon and so made her his ally,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think of that. i wonder what happened to her.,chit-chat
or we could tell of that cake the pirates cooked so that the boys might eat it and perish and how they placed it in one cunning spot after another but always wendy snatched it from the hands of her children so that in time it lost its succulence and became as hard as a stone and was used as a missile and hook fell over it in the dark,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i've never heard of that cake before. do you have a favorite cake?",chit-chat
or suppose we tell of the birds that were peters friends particularly of the never bird that built in a tree overhanging the lagoon and how the nest fell into the water and still the bird sat on her eggs and peter gave orders that she was not to be disturbed,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of that bird before. what's the name of the bird?,chit-chat
that is a pretty story and the end shows how grateful a bird can be but if we tell it we must also tell the whole adventure of the lagoon which would of course be telling two adventures rather than just one,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure how i feel about it though.,chit-chat
a shorter adventure and quite as exciting was tinker bells attempt with the help of some street fairies to have the sleeping wendy conveyed on a great floating leaf to the mainland,novel
that sounds like a very exciting adventure. did you get to see any of the fairy tales?,chit-chat
fortunately the leaf gave way and wendy woke thinking it was bathtime and swam back,novel
that's great! i'm glad it didn't end up in the ocean.,chit-chat
or again we might choose peters defiance of the lions when he drew a circle round him on the ground with an arrow and dared them to cross it and though he waited for hours with the other boys and wendy looking on breathlessly from trees not one of them dared to accept his challenge,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i've never heard of peters defiance of the lions before.",chit-chat
which of these adventures shall we choose,novel
"i'm not sure, but i think i'll go with the one i've always wanted.",chit-chat
the best way will be to toss for it,novel
that's what i'm thinking. i just don't know what to do with it.,chit-chat
i have tossed and the lagoon has won,novel
congrats! that's a great feeling. i'm sure you'll do great!,chit-chat
this almost makes one wish that the gulch or the cake or tinks leaf had won,novel
the gulch or the cake or tleaf would have been great. i would have loved that.,chit-chat
of course i could do it again and make it best out of three however perhaps fairest to stick to the lagoon,novel
that's a good idea. i've never been to the lagoon before. what's it like?,chit-chat
chapter viii,novel
i'm a big fan of chapter 16. it's the first volume of the manga.,chit-chat
the mermaids lagoon if you shut your eyes and are a lucky one you may see at times a shapeless pool of lovely pale colours suspended in the darkness then if you squeeze your eyes tighter the pool begins to take shape and the colours become so vivid that with another squeeze they must go on fire,novel
i've never heard of the mermaids lagoon before. i'll have to check it out.,chit-chat
but just before they go on fire you see the lagoon,novel
"i've never been to the lagoon, but i'd like to go one day.",chit-chat
this is the nearest you ever get to it on the mainland just one heavenly moment if there could be two moments you might see the surf and hear the mermaids singing,novel
"i've never been to the beach, but i'd love to go one day.",chit-chat
the children often spent long summer days on this lagoon swimming or floating most of the time playing the mermaid games in the water and so forth,novel
"that sounds like a lot of fun! i've never been to the mermaid games, but i'd love to go one day.",chit-chat
you must not think from this that the mermaids were on friendly terms with them on the contrary it was among wendys lasting regrets that all the time she was on the island she never had a civil word from one of them,novel
i don't think i've ever heard of a mermaids being on friendly terms with them.,chit-chat
when she stole softly to the edge of the lagoon she might see them by the score especially on marooners rock where they loved to bask combing out their hair in a lazy way that quite irritated her or she might even swim on tiptoe as it were to within a yard of them but then they saw her and dived probably splashing her with their tails not by accident but intentionally,novel
that's so funny! i've never heard of marooners rock. what's it about?,chit-chat
they treated all the boys in the same way except of course peter who chatted with them on marooners rock by the hour and sat on their tails when they got cheeky,novel
i don't think i've ever seen a marooners rock video. what was it about?,chit-chat
he gave wendy one of their combs,novel
that's nice of him. i'm sure he's very proud of her.,chit-chat
the most haunting time at which to see them is at the turn of the moon when they utter strange wailing cries but the lagoon is dangerous for mortals then and until the evening of which we have now to tell wendy had never seen the lagoon by moonlight less from fear for of course peter would have accompanied her than because she had strict rules about every one being in bed by seven,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i'm not sure i've ever seen that.",chit-chat
she was often at the lagoon however on sunny days after rain when the mermaids come up in extraordinary numbers to play with their bubbles,novel
"i've never been to the lagoon, but i'd love to go one day.",chit-chat
the bubbles of many colours made in rainbow water they treat as balls hitting them gaily from one to another with their tails and trying to keep them in the rainbow till they burst,novel
that's interesting. i didn't know that. do you have a favorite color?,chit-chat
the goals are at each end of the rainbow and the keepers only are allowed to use their hands,novel
that's interesting. i didn't know that. do you have a favorite keeper?,chit-chat
sometimes a dozen of these games will be going on in the lagoon at a time and it is quite a pretty sight,novel
"i've never been to the lagoon, but i'd love to go one day.",chit-chat
but the moment the children tried to join in they had to play by themselves for the mermaids immediately disappeared,novel
that's so sad. i can't imagine what it must have been like to have to go through that.,chit-chat
nevertheless we have proof that they secretly watched the interlopers and were not above taking an idea from them for john introduced a new way of hitting the bubble with the head instead of the hand and the mermaids adopted it,novel
that's a very interesting theory. i've never heard of that before. do you have a source?,chit-chat
this is the one mark that john has left on the neverland,novel
i'm not familiar with the neverland. what is it about it that you don't like?,chit-chat
it must also have been rather pretty to see the children resting on a rock for half an hour after their midday meal,novel
i bet it was. i'm glad they were able to get out of the house.,chit-chat
wendy insisted on their doing this and it had to be a real rest even though the meal was makebelieve,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i've had that happen to me a few times.,chit-chat
so they lay there in the sun and their bodies glistened in it while she sat beside them and looked important,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad she was there to help.,chit-chat
it was one such day and they were all on marooners rock,novel
that must have been a fun day. did you get to see any of the new bands?,chit-chat
the rock was not much larger than their great bed but of course they all knew how not to take up much room and they were dozing or at least lying with their eyes shut and pinching occasionally when they thought wendy was not looking,novel
that's really interesting. i've never seen a rock before. what kind of rock is it?,chit-chat
she was very busy stitching,novel
that's a good thing to do. i'm sure she'll be fine.,chit-chat
while she stitched a change came to the lagoon,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never been to the lagoon. what's it like?,chit-chat
little shivers ran over it and the sun went away and shadows stole across the water turning it cold,novel
that must have been scary. did you have to get out of the house to get to it?,chit-chat
wendy could no longer see to thread her needle and when she looked up the lagoon that had always hitherto been such a laughing place seemed formidable and unfriendly,novel
"hey there, how are you? i've never been there, but i'd like to go.",chit-chat
it was not she knew that night had come but something as dark as night had come,novel
that's not good. did you find out who it was? did you tell her?,chit-chat
no worse than that,novel
i know right? i was so mad at him for doing that. i don't know what i would do without him.,chit-chat
it had not come but it had sent that shiver through the sea to say that it was coming,novel
that's so scary! what did you do to scare it away? was it scary?,chit-chat
what was it,novel
"i'm not sure what it was, but i think it was some kind of animal.",chit-chat
there crowded upon her all the stories she had been told of marooners rock so called because evil captains put sailors on it and leave them there to drown,novel
"wow, that's terrible. i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she's okay.",chit-chat
they drown when the tide rises for then it is submerged,novel
that's a good way of looking at it. i didn't think of that.,chit-chat
of course she should have roused the children at once not merely because of the unknown that was stalking toward them but because it was no longer good for them to sleep on a rock grown chilly,novel
i don't think she should have roused them at all. i'm glad she didn't.,chit-chat
but she was a young mother and she did not know this she thought you simply must stick to your rule about half an hour after the midday meal,novel
"wow, that's a long time to be a mother. i'm sorry you had to go through that.",chit-chat
so though fear was upon her and she longed to hear male voices she would not waken them,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
even when she heard the sound of muffled oars though her heart was in her mouth she did not waken them,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you were able to get them back soon.,chit-chat
she stood over them to let them have their sleep out,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad she didn't do that.,chit-chat
was it not brave of wendy,novel
"i don't think it was brave of wendy, but i do think it could have been.",chit-chat
it was well for those boys then that there was one among them who could sniff danger even in his sleep,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he's doing well now.,chit-chat
peter sprang erect as wide awake at once as a dog and with one warning cry he roused the others,novel
"oh my god, that's so funny! i'm laughing so hard right now.",chit-chat
he stood motionless one hand to his ear,novel
"oh wow, that's pretty impressive. i'm glad he didn't get hurt.",chit-chat
pirates he cried,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. have you ever been to a pirate's ship?,chit-chat
the others came closer to him,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad they came close to him.,chit-chat
a strange smile was playing about his face and wendy saw it and shuddered,novel
that's pretty funny. i'm sure wendy didn't think it was funny.,chit-chat
while that smile was on his face no one dared address him all they could do was to stand ready to obey,novel
that's what i was thinking. i don't know why they didn't.,chit-chat
the order came sharp and incisive,novel
i'm glad to hear that. what kind of order did you end up going with?,chit-chat
dive there was a gleam of legs and instantly the lagoon seemed deserted,novel
"i've never been diving, but i'd like to try it one day. what did you do?",chit-chat
marooners rock stood alone in the forbidding waters as if it were itself marooned,novel
marooners rock stood alone in the forbidding waters as if it were itself marooned,chit-chat
the boat drew nearer,novel
have you ever been to the boat drew drew? it's a boat made of wood.,chit-chat
it was the pirate dinghy with three figures in her smee and starkey and the third a captive no other than tiger lily,novel
"wow, that's a lot of figures. did you get to see any of them?",chit-chat
her hands and ankles were tied and she knew what was to be her fate,novel
that's really cool. i'm glad she was able to do it. what was her fate?,chit-chat
she was to be left on the rock to perish an end to one of her race more terrible than death by fire or torture for is it not written in the book of the tribe that there is no path through water to the happy huntingground,novel
that's interesting. i've never read the book of the tribe. what is it about?,chit-chat
yet her face was impassive she was the daughter of a chief she must die as a chiefs daughter it is enough,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a big fan of chiefs.",chit-chat
they had caught her boarding the pirate ship with a knife in her mouth,novel
"oh wow, that must have been scary. did you find out who did it or what?",chit-chat
no watch was kept on the ship it being hooks boast that the wind of his name guarded the ship for a mile around,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get back on the ship.,chit-chat
now her fate would help to guard it also,novel
"that's true, but i don't know if she'll be able to.",chit-chat
one more wail would go the round in that wind by night,novel
that's a good way to look at it. what do you do for a living?,chit-chat
in the gloom that they brought with them the two pirates did not see the rock till they crashed into it,novel
"oh wow, that's pretty cool. what kind of gloom did they bring with them?",chit-chat
luff you lubber cried an irish voice that was smees heres the rock,novel
luff you lubber cried an irish voice that was smees heres the rock * *,chit-chat
now then what we have to do is to hoist the redskin on to it and leave her here to drown it was the work of one brutal moment to land the beautiful girl on the rock she was too proud to offer a vain resistance,novel
"that sounds like a lot of work, but i'm sure it's worth it in the end.",chit-chat
quite near the rock but out of sight two heads were bobbing up and down peters and wendys,novel
that's pretty cool. did you see any other people? i've never seen anything like that before.,chit-chat
wendy was crying for it was the first tragedy she had seen,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope she's okay. what happened?,chit-chat
peter had seen many tragedies but he had forgotten them all,novel
that's so sad. i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's doing better now.,chit-chat
he was less sorry than wendy for tiger lily it was two against one that angered him and he meant to save her,novel
i don't think he meant to do that. i think he was trying to save her.,chit-chat
an easy way would have been to wait until the pirates had gone but he was never one to choose the easy way,novel
"that would have been an easy way, but he was never one to choose the easy way.",chit-chat
there was almost nothing he could not do and he now imitated the voice of hook,novel
that's awesome! hook is one of my favorite hip hop artists. how long have you been listening to him?,chit-chat
ahoy there you lubbers he called,novel
"i'm not sure what you mean by lubbers, but i don't think that means what you think it means.",chit-chat
it was a marvellous imitation,novel
what did you do to make it a marvellous imitation? did you get caught?,chit-chat
the captain said the pirates staring at each other in surprise,novel
"that's pretty cool. i've never been to a pirates game, but i'd like to go one day.",chit-chat
he must be swimming out to us starkey said when they had looked for him in vain,novel
that's so sad. i hope he's okay. i'm sure he'll be fine.,chit-chat
we are putting the redskin on the rock smee called out,novel
that's a good idea. i've never done that before. what did you do?,chit-chat
set her free came the astonishing answer,novel
what was the astonanswer? i can't seem to figure it out...,chit-chat
free yes cut her bonds and let her go but captain at once dye hear cried peter or ill plunge my hook in you this is queer smee gasped,novel
"i'm not sure what you're trying to say, but i don't get it.",chit-chat
better do what the captain orders said starkey nervously,novel
i'm not sure what starkey is. i've never heard of starkey.,chit-chat
ay ay smee said and he cut tiger lilys cords,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm not familiar with tiger lilys. what kind of cords did he cut?,chit-chat
at once like an eel she slid between starkeys legs into the water,novel
"oh wow, that must have been scary. did you have to get out of the water?",chit-chat
of course wendy was very elated over peters cleverness but she knew that he would be elated also and very likely crow and thus betray himself so at once her hand went out to cover his mouth,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think of it that way. i guess that makes sense.,chit-chat
but it was stayed even in the act for boat ahoy rang over the lagoon in hooks voice and this time it was not peter who had spoken,novel
that's interesting. i didn't know that. do you have a source for that?,chit-chat
peter may have been about to crow but his face puckered in a whistle of surprise instead,novel
i don't think so. i think it's more likely that he was just trying to be funny.,chit-chat
boat ahoy again came the voice,novel
i love boat ahoy. it's one of my favorite songs. what's your favorite song?,chit-chat
now wendy understood,novel
i don't understand what you mean by that. are you referring to something i'm not getting?,chit-chat
the real hook was also in the water,novel
the real hook was in the water... that's what i'm talking about.,chit-chat
he was swimming to the boat and as his men showed a light to guide him he had soon reached them,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never been on a boat before. what kind of boat was it?,chit-chat
in the light of the lantern wendy saw his hook grip the boats side she saw his evil swarthy face as he rose dripping from the water and quaking she would have liked to swim away but peter would not budge,novel
"wow, that's pretty intense. i'm not sure if i could do that.",chit-chat
he was tingling with life and also topheavy with conceit,novel
that's awesome! i'm so happy for him. i hope he's doing well.,chit-chat
am i not a wonder oh i am a wonder he whispered to her and though she thought so also she was really glad for the sake of his reputation that no one heard him except herself,novel
"i don't think he's a good person, but i'm glad for him.",chit-chat
he signed to her to listen,novel
"oh, that's pretty cool. what kind of music do you like to listen to?",chit-chat
the two pirates were very curious to know what had brought their captain to them but he sat with his head on his hook in a position of profound melancholy,novel
that's interesting. what did the two pirates do to get the captain to bring them to them?,chit-chat
captain is all well they asked timidly but he answered with a hollow moan,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's doing well. what did he say?,chit-chat
he sighs said smee,novel
i hate when people say smelly things like that. it's so gross to me.,chit-chat
he sighs again said starkey,novel
what did he say about starkey? i've never heard of it before. what's it about?,chit-chat
and yet a third time he sighs said smee,novel
i know right? i can't believe he's been doing that for so long.,chit-chat
then at last he spoke passionately,novel
"what did he say? i don't know much about him, but i'm curious.",chit-chat
the games up he cried those boys have found a mother affrighted though she was wendy swelled with pride,novel
that's so sad. i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she's okay.,chit-chat
o evil day cried starkey,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. do you have a favorite starkey song to cry about?,chit-chat
whats a mother asked the ignorant smee,novel
i don't know... i'm not sure what to say to her.,chit-chat
wendy was so shocked that she exclaimed,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you saying that she was shocked?,chit-chat
he doesnt know and always after this she felt that if you could have a pet pirate smee would be her one,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to talk to him about it.,chit-chat
peter pulled her beneath the water for hook had started up crying what was that i heard nothing said starkey raising the lantern over the waters and as the pirates looked they saw a strange sight,novel
that's crazy! i've never seen anything like that before. i'm glad peter is okay.,chit-chat

see said hook in answer to smees question that is a mother,novel
i've never heard of that hook in answer to smees question. what's it about?,chit-chat
what a lesson,novel
"i know, i was so happy when i found out it was her. i felt so bad for her.",chit-chat
the nest must have fallen into the water but would the mother desert her eggs,novel
i don't think so. i'm not sure what caused the nest to fall into the water.,chit-chat
no there was a break in his voice as if for a moment he recalled innocent days whenbut he brushed away this weakness with his hook,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i don't think i could do that.,chit-chat
smee much impressed gazed at the bird as the nest was borne past but the more suspicious starkey said if she is a mother perhaps she is hanging about here to help peter hook winced,novel
that's a good theory. i've never heard of peter hook before. what does he do?,chit-chat
ay he said that is the fear that haunts me he was roused from this dejection by smees eager voice,novel
i'm not familiar with smees'voice. what does he say about his dejection?,chit-chat
captain said smee could we not kidnap these boys mother and make her our mother it is a princely scheme cried hook and at once it took practical shape in his great brain,novel
that's so sad. i'm sorry you had to go through that. i hope you're doing better now.,chit-chat
we will seize the children and carry them to the boat the boys we will make walk the plank and wendy shall be our mother again wendy forgot herself,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. i'm sure you'll have a great time.,chit-chat
never she cried and bobbed,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
what was that but they could see nothing,novel
that's what i'm wondering. i don't know what to do now.,chit-chat
they thought it must have been a leaf in the wind,novel
oh no! what did you do to make it look like it was a leaf in the wind?,chit-chat
do you agree my bullies asked hook,novel
i don't think i've ever asked a hook before. what did they ask?,chit-chat

i don't think so. i'm not a big fan of codfish.,chit-chat
it is lowering to our pride they were his dogs snapping at him but tragic figure though he had become he scarcely heeded them,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope he's doing better now. what a terrible thing to happen.,chit-chat
against such fearful evidence it was not their belief in him that he needed it was his own,novel
that's a good point. it's hard for me to believe that he didn't know what he was doing.,chit-chat
he felt his ego slipping from him,novel
that's a good way to look at it. what did he do to deserve that?,chit-chat
dont desert me bully he whispered hoarsely to it,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat

the others were all brave boys and they must not be blamed for backing from the pirate captain,novel
i don't blame them for backing from the pirate captain. i blame him for being so careless.,chit-chat
his iron claw made a circle of dead water round him from which they fled like affrighted fishes,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. did you find out who he was or what he did?",chit-chat
but there was one who did not fear him there was one prepared to enter that circle,novel
that's a good one. it's always good to be prepared for situations like that.,chit-chat
strangely it was not in the water that they met,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope it wasn't in the water that they met.,chit-chat
hook rose to the rock to breathe and at the same moment peter scaled it on the opposite side,novel
i've never seen the hook to breathe. i'll have to check it out.,chit-chat
the rock was slippery as a ball and they had to crawl rather than climb,novel

after all he was the only man that the seacook had feared,novel

quick as thought he snatched a knife from hooks belt and was about to drive it home when he saw that he was higher up the rock than his foe,novel
oh no! that's terrible. i hope he didn't get hurt too bad.,chit-chat
it would not have been fighting fair,novel
i don't think so. i think it would have been a lot worse than it was.,chit-chat
he gave the pirate a hand to help him up,novel
"oh, i didn't know that. that's pretty cool. what did he do?",chit-chat

no one ever gets over the first unfairness no one except peter,novel
peter is such a great character. he's one of my favorite characters of all time.,chit-chat
he often met it but he always forgot it,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. do you think he'll come back next year?,chit-chat
i suppose that was the real difference between him and all the rest,novel
"yes, it was. i felt so bad for him, but i was so proud of him.",chit-chat
so when he met it now it was like the first time and he could just stare helpless,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he's okay.,chit-chat
twice the iron hand clawed him,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you talking about the iron hand?,chit-chat
a few moments afterwards the other boys saw hook in the water striking wildly for the ship no elation on the pestilent face now only white fear for the crocodile was in dogged pursuit of him,novel
"wow, that's scary. i'm glad the crocodile didn't get hurt.",chit-chat
on ordinary occasions the boys would have swum alongside cheering but now they were uneasy for they had lost both peter and wendy and were scouring the lagoon for them calling them by name,novel
that's so sad. i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay.,chit-chat
they found the dinghy and went home in it shouting peter wendy as they went but no answer came save mocking laughter from the mermaids,novel
that's so funny! did they find the dinghy and go home in it shouting peter wendy as they went but no answer came save mock laughter from the mermaids?,chit-chat
they must be swimming back or flying the boys concluded,novel
i don't think so. i'm not sure what they are going to do.,chit-chat
they were not very anxious because they had such faith in peter,novel
that's a good reason to be anxious. i'm glad they were able to work it out.,chit-chat
they chuckled boylike because they would be late for bed and it was all mother wendys fault,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get some sleep.,chit-chat
when their voices died away there came cold silence over the lagoon and then a feeble cry,novel

he knew that they would soon be drowned but he could do no more,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's doing better now. what did he do?,chit-chat
as they lay side by side a mermaid caught wendy by the feet and began pulling her softly into the water,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never seen a mermaid in the water before. what did they do?,chit-chat
peter feeling her slip from him woke with a start and was just in time to draw her back,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he didn't do that.,chit-chat
but he had to tell her the truth,novel
that's what i'm saying. i don't understand why he didn't tell her.,chit-chat
we are on the rock wendy he said but it is growing smaller,novel
that's good to hear. i'm sure it's going to get better.,chit-chat

i cant help you wendy,novel
i don't know what i'm going to do. i can't stop thinking about it.,chit-chat
hook wounded me,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. hook is a great song. what happened to it?,chit-chat
i can neither fly nor swim do you mean we shall both be drowned look how the water is rising they put their hands over their eyes to shut out the sight,novel
"yes, that's exactly what i mean. do you have any other hobbies?",chit-chat
they thought they would soon be no more,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
as they sat thus something brushed against peter as light as a kiss and stayed there as if saying timidly can i be of any use it was the tail of a kite which michael had made some days before,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of a kite before. what kind of kite was it?,chit-chat
it had torn itself out of his hand and floated away,novel
"oh no, that's terrible. i hope it didn't hurt too much. what happened?",chit-chat
michaels kite peter said without interest but next moment he had seized the tail and was pulling the kite toward him,novel

it lifted michael off the ground he cried why should it not carry you both of us it cant lift two michael and curly tried let us draw lots wendy said bravely,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get it fixed.,chit-chat
and you a lady never already he had tied the tail round her,novel

she clung to him she refused to go without him but with a goodbye wendy he pushed her from the rock and in a few minutes she was borne out of his sight,novel
"wow, that's pretty intense. i'm not sure if i could do that.",chit-chat
peter was alone on the lagoon,novel
peter was alone on the lagoon? i've never heard of that. what did peter do?,chit-chat
the rock was very small now soon it would be submerged,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find it soon.,chit-chat
pale rays of light tiptoed across the waters and by and by there was to be heard a sound at once the most musical and the most melancholy in the world the mermaids calling to the moon,novel
"i've never been to the moon, but i'd like to go one day.",chit-chat
peter was not quite like other boys but he was afraid at last,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did he do to make you feel that way?,chit-chat
a tremour ran through him like a shudder passing over the sea but on the sea one shudder follows another till there are hundreds of them and peter felt just the one,novel
"wow, that's scary! i'm glad you were able to get away from him.",chit-chat
next moment he was standing erect on the rock again with that smile on his face and a drum beating within him,novel
hahaha... that's so funny. i'm laughing so hard right now.,chit-chat
it was saying to die will be an awfully big adventure chapter ix,novel
i don't know if i'm ready for that. it's been a while since i've seen it.,chit-chat
the never bird the last sound peter heard before he was quite alone were the mermaids retiring one by one to their bedchambers under the sea,novel
i've never heard of the never bird the last sound peter heard before he was quite alone were the mermaids retiring one by one to their bedchambers under the sea,chit-chat
he was too far away to hear their doors shut but every door in the coral caves where they live rings a tiny bell when it opens or closes as in all the nicest houses on the mainland and he heard the bells,novel
"wow, that's pretty cool. i've never been to a coral cave before.",chit-chat
steadily the waters rose till they were nibbling at his feet and to pass the time until they made their final gulp he watched the only thing on the lagoon,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. what kind of music do you like to listen to?,chit-chat
he thought it was a piece of floating paper perhaps part of the kite and wondered idly how long it would take to drift ashore,novel
"that's a good guess, but i'm not sure how long it would take.",chit-chat
presently he noticed as an odd thing that it was undoubtedly out upon the lagoon with some definite purpose for it was fighting the tide and sometimes winning and when it won peter always sympathetic to the weaker side could not help clapping it was such a gallant piece of paper,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of a gallant piece of paper before.,chit-chat
it was not really a piece of paper it was the never bird making desperate efforts to reach peter on the nest,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find him soon.,chit-chat
by working her wings in a way she had learned since the nest fell into the water she was able to some extent to guide her strange craft but by the time peter recognised her she was very exhausted,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. i've always wanted to learn how to fly.",chit-chat
she had come to save him to give him her nest though there were eggs in it,novel
that's very nice of her. i'm sure she's proud of him.,chit-chat
i rather wonder at the bird for though he had been nice to her he had also sometimes tormented her,novel
i don't think i've ever seen a bird tormenting a human before.,chit-chat
i can suppose only that like mrs,novel
that's what i was thinking. i'm not sure if i'll ever get married.,chit-chat
darling and the rest of them she was melted because he had all his first teeth,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's doing better now that he has all his teeth.,chit-chat
she called out to him what she had come for and he called out to her what she was doing there but of course neither of them understood the others language,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
in fanciful stories people can talk to the birds freely and i wish for the moment i could pretend that this were such a story and say that peter replied intelligently to the never bird but truth is best and i want to tell you only what really happened,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by fanciful stories people can talk to the birds freely and i wish for the moment i could pretend that this were such a story and say that peter replied intelligently to the never bird but truth is best and i want to tell you only what really happened,chit-chat
well not only could they not understand each other but they forgot their manners,novel
that's so true. it's like they don't even know what they're doing.,chit-chat
iwantyoutogetintothenest the bird called speaking as slowly and distinctly as possible andthenyoucandriftashore butiamtootiredtobringitanynearersoyoumusttry toswimtoit what are you quacking about peter answered,novel
i've never heard of that bird before. i'll have to look it up.,chit-chat
why dont you let the nest drift as usual iwantyou the bird said and repeated it all over,novel
that's a good idea. i'll try that next time. do you have a favorite bird?,chit-chat
then peter tried slow and distinct,novel
"that's what i thought too, but then i realized that it was peter who did it.",chit-chat
whatareyouquackingabout and so on,novel
i'm trying to figure out what to do with my life. i don't know what i want to do.,chit-chat
the never bird became irritated they have very short tempers,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope it didn't upset you too much.,chit-chat
you dunderheaded little jay she screamed why dont you do as i tell you peter felt that she was calling him names and at a venture he retorted hotly so are you then rather curiously they both snapped out the same remark shut up shut up nevertheless the bird was determined to save him if she could and by one last mighty effort she propelled the nest against the rock,novel
"i'm sorry, i don't understand what you're saying. what are you trying to say?",chit-chat
then up she flew deserting her eggs so as to make her meaning clear,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad she didn't do that.,chit-chat
then at last he understood and clutched the nest and waved his thanks to the bird as she fluttered overhead,novel
that's so sweet of him. i'm glad he was able to learn from his mistakes.,chit-chat
it was not to receive his thanks however that she hung there in the sky it was not even to watch him get into the nest it was to see what he did with her eggs,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
there were two large white eggs and peter lifted them up and reflected,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never seen a white egg before. what was the name of the egg?,chit-chat
the bird covered her face with her wings so as not to see the last of them but she could not help peeping between the feathers,novel
"oh wow, that's interesting. did she have a lot of trouble seeing the last of them?",chit-chat
i forget whether i have told you that there was a stave on the rock driven into it by some buccaneers of long ago to mark the site of buried treasure,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of that before. do you have a source?,chit-chat
the children had discovered the glittering hoard and when in a mischievous mood used to fling showers of moidores diamonds pearls and pieces of eight to the gulls who pounced upon them for food and then flew away raging at the scurvy trick that had been played upon them,novel
"wow, that sounds like a lot of fun. what was the scurvy trick that was played on them?",chit-chat
the stave was still there and on it starkey had hung his hat a deep tarpaulin watertight with a broad brim,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never heard of starkey before. what's his name?,chit-chat
peter put the eggs into this hat and set it on the lagoon,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you saying that peter put the eggs into this hat and set it on the lagoon?,chit-chat
it floated beautifully,novel
i'm glad you like it. it's one of my favorite things to do.,chit-chat
the never bird saw at once what he was up to and screamed her admiration of him and alas peter crowed his agreement with her,novel
that's so funny! i've never seen that movie. what was it about?,chit-chat
then he got into the nest reared the stave in it as a mast and hung up his shirt for a sail,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never seen a sail like that before. what kind of sail is it?,chit-chat
at the same moment the bird fluttered down upon the hat and once more sat snugly on her eggs,novel
that's so funny! did you find out who it was? did you catch it?,chit-chat
she drifted in one direction and he was borne off in another both cheering,novel
that's so sad. i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she's okay.,chit-chat
of course when peter landed he beached his barque in a place where the bird would easily find it but the hat was such a great success that she abandoned the nest,novel
i didn't know she abandoned the nest. that's so sad. i'm glad she found it.,chit-chat
it drifted about till it went to pieces and often starkey came to the shore of the lagoon and with many bitter feelings watched the bird sitting on his hat,novel
that's so sad. i'm sorry you had to go through that. what did you do?,chit-chat
as we shall not see her again it may be worth mentioning here that all never birds now build in that shape of nest with a broad brim on which the youngsters take an airing,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you have a good rest of your day.,chit-chat
great were the rejoicings when peter reached the home under the ground almost as soon as wendy who had been carried hither and thither by the kite,novel
that's so sad. i can't imagine what that must've been like.,chit-chat
every boy had adventures to tell but perhaps the biggest adventure of all was that they were several hours late for bed,novel
"wow, that must have been quite an adventure. did you have to go to bed early?",chit-chat
this so inflated them that they did various dodgy things to get staying up still longer such as demanding bandages but wendy though glorying in having them all home again safe and sound was scandalised by the lateness of the hour and cried to bed to bed in a voice that had to be obeyed,novel
"wow, that's crazy. i'm sorry you had to go through that. i hope you're okay.",chit-chat
next day however she was awfully tender and gave out bandages to every one and they played till bedtime at limping about and carrying their arms in slings,novel
that's terrible. i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she's okay.,chit-chat
chapter x,novel
i'm a big fan of x - men. it's an american comic book.,chit-chat

"that's really cool. i've never been to a happy home, but i'd love to go one day.",chit-chat
peter had saved tiger lily from a dreadful fate and now there was nothing she and her braves would not do for him,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find peace in your life.,chit-chat
all night they sat above keeping watch over the home under the ground and awaiting the big attack by the pirates which obviously could not be much longer delayed,novel
"oh wow, that must have been scary. i hope you're okay. what did they do?",chit-chat
even by day they hung about smoking the pipe of peace and looking almost as if they wanted titbits to eat,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
they called peter the great white father prostrating themselves before him and he liked this tremendously so that it was not really good for him,novel

i love tiger lily. she's my favorite character in the whole series. do you have a favorite character?,chit-chat
peter pan save me me his velly nice friend,novel
have you heard of peter pan? it's an american animated film made by peter pan.,chit-chat
me no let pirates hurt him she was far too pretty to cringe in this way but peter thought it his due and he would answer condescendingly it is good,novel
i don't think i've ever seen a movie like that before. what was it about?,chit-chat
peter pan has spoken always when he said peter pan has spoken it meant that they must now shut up and they accepted it humbly in that spirit but they were by no means so respectful to the other boys whom they looked upon as just ordinary braves,novel
that's interesting. i didn't know that. do you know who peter pan is?,chit-chat
they said howdo to them and things like that and what annoyed the boys was that peter seemed to think this all right,novel
i don't think i've ever seen a show like that before. what was it about?,chit-chat
secretly wendy sympathised with them a little but she was far too loyal a housewife to listen to any complaints against father,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she's able to get over it.,chit-chat
father knows best she always said whatever her private opinion must be,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to talk to him about it.,chit-chat
her private opinion was that the redskins should not call her a squaw,novel
that's not very nice of her. i'm glad she's doing better now.,chit-chat

that's awesome! i'm so happy for you. i hope you have a great day!,chit-chat
the day as if quietly gathering its forces had been almost uneventful and now the redskins in their blankets were at their posts above while below the children were having their evening meal all except peter who had gone out to get the time,novel
that's so sad. i'm sorry you had to go through that. i hope you're doing better now.,chit-chat
the way you got the time on the island was to find the crocodile and then stay near him till the clock struck,novel
that's a good idea. i didn't think of that. i'll have to do that next time.,chit-chat
the meal happened to be a makebelieve tea and they sat around the board guzzling in their greed and really what with their chatter and recriminations the noise as wendy said was positively deafening,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. what kind of tea was it? what was the name of the tea?,chit-chat
to be sure she did not mind noise but she simply would not have them grabbing things and then excusing themselves by saying that tootles had pushed their elbow,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think about it that way. i'll have to make sure i don't do that again.,chit-chat
there was a fixed rule that they must never hit back at meals but should refer the matter of dispute to wendy by raising the right arm politely and saying i complain of soandso but what usually happened was that they forgot to do this or did it too much,novel
"i don't think they forgot to do that, i think they just didn't notice.",chit-chat
silence cried wendy when for the twentieth time she had told them that they were not all to speak at once,novel

you see he continued apologetically it would make me seem so old to be their real father but they are ours peter yours and mine but not really wendy he asked anxiously,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
not if you dont wish it she replied and she distinctly heard his sigh of relief,novel
that's a good point. i guess i'll just have to let it go.,chit-chat
peter she asked trying to speak firmly what are your exact feelings to me those of a devoted son wendy i thought so she said and went and sat by herself at the extreme end of the room,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to talk to her about it.,chit-chat
you are so queer he said frankly puzzled and tiger lily is just the same,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you saying that tiger lily is just the same as tiger lily?,chit-chat
there is something she wants to be to me but she says it is not my mother no indeed it is not wendy replied with frightful emphasis,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. do you think it's possible that she's lying to you?,chit-chat
now we know why she was prejudiced against the redskins,novel
"i don't know why she was prejudiced against the redskins, but i'm glad she wasn't.",chit-chat
then what is it it isnt for a lady to tell oh very well peter said a little nettled,novel
i don't know. i'm not sure if it's a good thing or not.,chit-chat
perhaps tinker bell will tell me oh yes tinker bell will tell you wendy retorted scornfully,novel
that's a great idea! i'm sure they'll be happy to hear that.,chit-chat
she is an abandoned little creature here tink who was in her bedroom eavesdropping squeaked out something impudent,novel
oh no! i hope she's okay. i'm sure she'll be fine.,chit-chat
she says she glories in being abandoned peter interpreted,novel
i've never heard of peter interpreted. what does he do for a living? i'm not familiar with him.,chit-chat
he had a sudden idea,novel
that's cool. what kind of ideas did he think he'd be able to come up with?,chit-chat
perhaps tink wants to be my mother you silly ass cried tinker bell in a passion,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did tink do to you to make you cry?,chit-chat
she had said it so often that wendy needed no translation,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. did she say why she did that or was she just being mean?,chit-chat
i almost agree with her wendy snapped,novel
i don't know much about her wendy snap. what is it about her that you agree with?,chit-chat
fancy wendy snapping,novel
have you ever seen a fancy fancy snap? it's when a person shakes their hand to snap a picture.,chit-chat
but she had been much tried and she little knew what was to happen before the night was out,novel
"that's true, but i still feel bad for her. she should have known better.",chit-chat
if she had known she would not have snapped,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad she didn't.,chit-chat
none of them knew,novel
that's so sad. i'm sorry you had to go through that. i hope you're doing better now.,chit-chat
perhaps it was best not to know,novel
that's what i'm thinking. i don't know what to do now.,chit-chat
their ignorance gave them one more glad hour and as it was to be their last hour on the island let us rejoice that there were sixty glad minutes in it,novel

they sang and danced in their nightgowns,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. what kind of nightgowns did they sing in?,chit-chat
such a deliciously creepy song it was in which they pretended to be frightened at their own shadows little witting that so soon shadows would close in upon them from whom they would shrink in real fear,novel
i've never heard of that song before. i'll have to check it out.,chit-chat
so uproariously gay was the dance and how they buffeted each other on the bed and out of it,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm not sure i'd be able to do that.,chit-chat
it was a pillow fight rather than a dance and when it was finished the pillows insisted on one bout more like partners who know that they may never meet again,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm sorry you had to go through that.,chit-chat
the stories they told before it was time for wendys goodnight story,novel
i love the stories they told before it was time for wendys goodnight story. it's one of my favorites.,chit-chat
even slightly tried to tell a story that night but the beginning was so fearfully dull that it appalled not only the others but himself and he said gloomily yes it is a dull beginning,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did you tell him to tell you about it?,chit-chat
i say let us pretend that it is the end and then at last they all got into bed for wendys story the story they loved best the story peter hated,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i don't know if i could handle that.,chit-chat
usually when she began to tell this story he left the room or put his hands over his ears and possibly if he had done either of those things this time they might all still be on the island,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i don't think i've ever done that before.,chit-chat
but tonight he remained on his stool and we shall see what happened,novel
that's awesome! i'm so happy for him. i hope he's doing well.,chit-chat

they were married you know explained wendy and what do you think they had white rats cried nibs inspired,novel
i don't think they were married. i think they just had a lot of fun.,chit-chat

they had three descendants what is descendants well you are one twin did you hear that john,novel

oh dear oh dear sighed wendy,novel
i can't even imagine what it must have been like to have that happen to you.,chit-chat
now these three children had a faithful nurse called nana but mr,novel
that's so sad. i'm sorry to hear that. i hope they're doing better now.,chit-chat
darling was angry with her and chained her up in the yard and so all the children flew away its an awfully good story said nibs,novel

do you nibs im frightfully anxious if you knew how great is a mothers love wendy told them triumphantly you would have no fear she had now come to the part that peter hated,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
i do like a mothers love said tootles hitting nibs with a pillow,novel
"that's funny, i've never heard of that before. what is it about?",chit-chat
do you like a mothers love nibs i do just said nibs hitting back,novel
i don't think i've ever heard of a mothers love nibs. do you?,chit-chat
you see wendy said complacently our heroine knew that the mother would always leave the window open for her children to fly back by so they stayed away for years and had a lovely time did they ever go back let us now said wendy bracing herself up for her finest effort take a peep into the future and they all gave themselves the twist that makes peeps into the future easier,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. i've never heard of that before. what's the twist?",chit-chat
years have rolled by and who is this elegant lady of uncertain age alighting at london station o wendy who is she cried nibs every bit as excited as if he didnt know,novel

"i don't know who the two noble portly figures are, but i do know that she's a good person.",chit-chat
can they be john and michael,novel
i don't think so. i'm pretty sure it's john and michael.,chit-chat
they are oh see dear brothers says wendy pointing upwards there is the window still standing open,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad you're okay.,chit-chat
ah now we are rewarded for our sublime faith in a mothers love so up they flew to their mummy and daddy and pen can not describe the happy scene over which we draw a veil that was the story and they were as pleased with it as the fair narrator herself,novel
that's so sweet! i'm so happy for you. i hope you have a wonderful day!,chit-chat
everything just as it should be you see,novel
that's a good way to look at it. it's always good to be optimistic.,chit-chat
off we skip like the most heartless things in the world which is what children are but so attractive and we have an entirely selfish time and then when we have need of special attention we nobly return for it confident that we shall be rewarded instead of smacked,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i don't think i could do that.,chit-chat
so great indeed was their faith in a mothers love that they felt they could afford to be callous for a bit longer,novel
that's a great way to look at it. i'm glad you were able to get through it.,chit-chat
but there was one there who knew better and when wendy finished he uttered a hollow groan,novel
oh really? i didn't know that. what was the name of the one who knew better?,chit-chat
what is it peter she cried running to him thinking he was ill she felt him solicitously lower down than his chest,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you talking about the dog or the cat?,chit-chat
where is it peter it isnt that kind of pain peter replied darkly,novel
"i don't know, i'm not sure. it's been a while since i've seen him.",chit-chat
then what kind is it wendy you are wrong about mothers they all gathered round him in affright so alarming was his agitation and with a fine candour he told them what he had hitherto concealed,novel
"i don't think it's right, but i'm not sure how to feel about it.",chit-chat
long ago he said i thought like you that my mother would always keep the window open for me so i stayed away for moons and moons and moons and then flew back but the window was barred for mother had forgotten all about me and there was another little boy sleeping in my bed i am not sure that this was true but peter thought it was true and it scared them,novel
"wow, that's scary! i'm sorry to hear that. did you find out who it was?",chit-chat
are you sure mothers are like that yes so this was the truth about mothers,novel
"i'm sure they're not like that, but i still feel bad for them.",chit-chat
the toads,novel
have you ever played the toads? it's a video game that was made by nintendo.,chit-chat
still it is best to be careful and no one knows so quickly as a child when he should give in,novel
that's true. i'm going to keep that in mind. thank you for the advice.,chit-chat
wendy let us go home cried john and michael together,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you were able to make it home safely.,chit-chat
yes she said clutching them,novel
what did she say? i've never heard of that before. what does it mean?,chit-chat
not tonight asked the lost boys bewildered,novel
why did you ask them to bewilder? did they not want you to do it?,chit-chat
they knew in what they called their hearts that one can get on quite well without a mother and that it is only the mothers who think you cant,novel
that's so true. it's amazing how many people don't understand that.,chit-chat
at once wendy replied resolutely for the horrible thought had come to her perhaps mother is in half mourning by this time this dread made her forgetful of what must be peters feelings and she said to him rather sharply peter will you make the necessary arrangements if you wish it he replied as coolly as if she had asked him to pass the nuts,novel
i don't understand what you're saying. are you trying to tell me something?,chit-chat
not so much as a sorrytoloseyou between them,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you saying you don't like them?,chit-chat
if she did not mind the parting he was going to show her was peter that neither did he,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think of that. i'll have to think about that.,chit-chat
but of course he cared very much and he was so full of wrath against grownups who as usual were spoiling everything that as soon as he got inside his tree he breathed intentionally quick short breaths at the rate of about five to a second,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he cared so much.,chit-chat
he did this because there is a saying in the neverland that every time you breathe a grownup dies and peter was killing them off vindictively as fast as possible,novel
i didn't know that. that's really interesting. what is the saying in the neverland?,chit-chat
then having given the necessary instructions to the redskins he returned to the home where an unworthy scene had been enacted in his absence,novel
that's so sad. i'm sorry you had to go through that. what happened?,chit-chat
panicstricken at the thought of losing wendy the lost boys had advanced upon her threateningly,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're doing better now. what happened to her?,chit-chat
it will be worse than before she came they cried,novel
that's true. i'm not sure if i'll be able to handle it.,chit-chat
we shant let her go lets keep her prisoner ay chain her up in her extremity an instinct told her to which of them to turn,novel
that's a good way to look at it. how long have you been with her?,chit-chat
tootles she cried i appeal to you was it not strange,novel
i've never heard of tootles before. what's it like to cry?,chit-chat
she appealed to tootles quite the silliest one,novel
i don't think i've ever heard of tootles. what is it?,chit-chat
grandly however did tootles respond,novel
"i don't think tootles did, but i'm not sure if they did.",chit-chat
for that one moment he dropped his silliness and spoke with dignity,novel
i can't imagine what that must have been like. i'm sure it was embarrassing.,chit-chat
i am just tootles he said and nobody minds me,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
but the first who does not behave to wendy like an english gentleman i will blood him severely he drew back his hanger and for that instant his sun was at noon,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
the others held back uneasily,novel
"i've never watched the others, but i know it's a good show. have you?",chit-chat
then peter returned and they saw at once that they would get no support from him,novel
that's so sad. i'm glad they didn't get any support from him.,chit-chat
he would keep no girl in the neverland against her will,novel
he would keep no girl in the neverland against her will. that's a good point.,chit-chat
wendy he said striding up and down i have asked the redskins to guide you through the wood as flying tires you so thank you peter then he continued in the short sharp voice of one accustomed to be obeyed tinker bell will take you across the sea,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i've never heard of a tinker bell before.",chit-chat
wake her nibs nibs had to knock twice before he got an answer though tink had really been sitting up in bed listening for some time,novel
what did tink say? i've never heard of tink's name before.,chit-chat
who are you,novel
i'm my own boss. i've been working on a new project for a while now.,chit-chat
how dare you,novel
i didn't mean to. i'm so sorry. i was so mad at myself.,chit-chat
go away she cried,novel
i don't think i can do that. i'm not sure what to do.,chit-chat
you are to get up tink nibs called and take wendy on a journey of course tink had been delighted to hear that wendy was going but she was jolly well determined not to be her courier and she said so in still more offensive language,novel
"i'm not sure what you mean by "" tink nibs "", but i don't know what that means.",chit-chat
then she pretended to be asleep again,novel
that's what i'm thinking too. i don't know what to do.,chit-chat
she says she wont nibs exclaimed aghast at such insubordination whereupon peter went sternly toward the young ladys chamber,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she's able to get through it.,chit-chat
tink he rapped out if you dont get up and dress at once i will open the curtains and then we shall all see you in your _negligée_ this made her leap to the floor,novel
that's a good idea. i'm not sure i could do that...,chit-chat
who said i wasnt getting up she cried,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. did you tell her why you weren't getting up?,chit-chat
in the meantime the boys were gazing very forlornly at wendy now equipped with john and michael for the journey,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun! did you get to go to the park with them?,chit-chat
by this time they were dejected not merely because they were about to lose her but also because they felt that she was going off to something nice to which they had not been invited,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad they didn't lose her.,chit-chat
novelty was beckoning to them as usual,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're having a good time with your family.,chit-chat
crediting them with a nobler feeling wendy melted,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never heard of that feeling before. what's it like?,chit-chat
dear ones she said if you will all come with me i feel almost sure i can get my father and mother to adopt you the invitation was meant specially for peter but each of the boys was thinking exclusively of himself and at once they jumped with joy,novel
that's really sweet of you to do. i'm sure you'll be fine.,chit-chat
but wont they think us rather a handful nibs asked in the middle of his jump,novel
i don't think so. i'm sure he'll be fine. he's a good dog.,chit-chat
oh no said wendy rapidly thinking it out it will only mean having a few beds in the drawingroom they can be hidden behind the screens on first thursdays peter can we go they all cried imploringly,novel
i can't wait to see how it plays out. it's going to be so much fun.,chit-chat
they took it for granted that if they went he would go also but really they scarcely cared,novel
i don't blame them. i've been there before and it's not fun at all.,chit-chat
thus children are ever ready when novelty knocks to desert their dearest ones,novel
"that's a good way to look at it, but i don't think i could do that.",chit-chat
all right peter replied with a bitter smile and immediately they rushed to get their things,novel
that's what i was thinking. i don't know what to do with my life.,chit-chat
and now peter wendy said thinking she had put everything right i am going to give you your medicine before you go she loved to give them medicine and undoubtedly gave them too much,novel
that's awful. i'm sorry you had to go through that. i hope you're doing better now.,chit-chat
of course it was only water but it was out of a bottle and she always shook the bottle and counted the drops which gave it a certain medicinal quality,novel
that's very nice of her. i'm glad you were able to help her.,chit-chat
on this occasion however she did not give peter his draught for just as she had prepared it she saw a look on his face that made her heart sink,novel
that's really sweet of her. i'm sure she's a great person.,chit-chat
get your things peter she cried shaking,novel
i don't think i'll be able to get them. i'm not sure what to do with them.,chit-chat
no he answered pretending indifference i am not going with you wendy yes peter no to show that her departure would leave him unmoved he skipped up and down the room playing gaily on his heartless pipes,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i've never heard of gaily on his pipe before.",chit-chat
she had to run about after him though it was rather undignified,novel
why did she have to run about after him? what did he do to make you think he was going to run away?,chit-chat
to find your mother she coaxed,novel
what is xed? i've never heard that term before. what does it mean?,chit-chat
now if peter had ever quite had a mother he no longer missed her,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure if i would have been able to get along with her.,chit-chat
he could do very well without one,novel
that's what i'm thinking. i don't know what to do with him.,chit-chat
he had thought them out and remembered only their bad points,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm sure he didn't.,chit-chat
no no he told wendy decisively perhaps she would say i was old and i just want always to be a little boy and to have fun but peter no and so the others had to be told,novel
i'm sorry you had to go through that. i hope you're doing better now.,chit-chat
peter isnt coming peter not coming,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. do you have any idea what's going on?,chit-chat
they gazed blankly at him their sticks over their backs and on each stick a bundle,novel
that's pretty funny. i'm glad they didn't do anything to him.,chit-chat
their first thought was that if peter was not going he had probably changed his mind about letting them go,novel
that's a good point. i didn't think of that. it makes sense.,chit-chat
but he was far too proud for that,novel
that's what i was thinking. i'm glad he was able to do it.,chit-chat
if you find your mothers he said darkly i hope you will like them the awful cynicism of this made an uncomfortable impression and most of them began to look rather doubtful,novel
i'm not sure if i'll like them. i don't know what to do.,chit-chat
after all their faces said were they not noodles to want to go,novel
that's so funny! i'm glad they didn't want to go. what did you do?,chit-chat
now then cried peter no fuss no blubbering goodbye wendy and he held out his hand cheerily quite as if they must really go now for he had something important to do,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
she had to take his hand and there was no indication that he would prefer a thimble,novel
that's a bummer. i'm sorry to hear that. what did you do?,chit-chat
you will remember about changing your flannels peter she said lingering over him,novel
that's a good one. i think i'm going to have to do that.,chit-chat
she was always so particular about their flannels,novel
"what did she say about them? i've never heard of them, but i'm curious.",chit-chat
yes and you will take your medicine yes that seemed to be everything and an awkward pause followed,novel
i hope so. it's been a long time since i've been on it.,chit-chat
peter however was not the kind that breaks down before other people,novel
peter was not the kind of person that breaks down before other people? i don't get it.,chit-chat
are you ready tinker bell he called out,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you asking if i am ready to be a tinker bell?,chit-chat
ay ay then lead the way tink darted up the nearest tree but no one followed her for it was at this moment that the pirates made their dreadful attack upon the redskins,novel
that's terrible. i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're ok.,chit-chat
above where all had been so still the air was rent with shrieks and the clash of steel,novel
i love the clash of steel! it's one of my favorite tv shows. have you seen it?,chit-chat
below there was dead silence,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you were able to get out of there.,chit-chat
mouths opened and remained open,novel
i do that all the time. i think it's because i'm not used to it.,chit-chat
wendy fell on her knees but her arms were extended toward peter,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're okay. did you get hurt?,chit-chat
all arms were extended to him as if suddenly blown in his direction they were beseeching him mutely not to desert them,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad he didn't have to do that.,chit-chat
as for peter he seized his sword the same he thought he had slain barbecue with and the lust of battle was in his eye,novel
that's interesting. i didn't know that. what did he do with the sword?,chit-chat
chapter xii,novel
i'm a big fan of chapter 12. it's the first volume of chapter 16.,chit-chat
the children are carried off the pirate attack had been a complete surprise a sure proof that the unscrupulous hook had conducted it improperly for to surprise redskins fairly is beyond the wit of the white man,novel
the children are carried off the pirate attack had been a complete surprise a sure proof that the unscrupulous hook had conducted it improperly for to surprise redskins fairly is beyond the wit of the white man,chit-chat
by all the unwritten laws of savage warfare it is always the redskin who attacks and with the wiliness of his race he does it just before the dawn at which time he knows the courage of the whites to be at its lowest ebb,novel
i'm not sure what you're trying to say. are you talking about the redskin?,chit-chat
the white men have in the meantime made a rude stockade on the summit of yonder undulating ground at the foot of which a stream runs for it is destruction to be too far from water,novel
i'm not sure what you're talking about. are you talking about the white men who made a rude stockade on the summit of yonder undulating ground at the foot of which a stream runs for it is destruction to be too far from water?,chit-chat
there they await the onslaught the inexperienced ones clutching their revolvers and treading on twigs but the old hands sleeping tranquilly until just before the dawn,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm not sure i could do that.,chit-chat
through the long black night the savage scouts wriggle snakelike among the grass without stirring a blade,novel
savage scouts wriggle snakelike among the grass without ~ ~ stir a blade ~ ~ * * fucking * * a blade!,chit-chat
the brushwood closes behind them as silently as sand into which a mole has dived,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard of the brushwood. what's it like?,chit-chat
not a sound is to be heard save when they give vent to a wonderful imitation of the lonely call of the coyote,novel
that's a good way to look at it. what do you do for a living?,chit-chat
the cry is answered by other braves and some of them do it even better than the coyotes who are not very good at it,novel
i'm not a fan of the coyotes. they're not very good at anything.,chit-chat
so the chill hours wear on and the long suspense is horribly trying to the paleface who has to live through it for the first time but to the trained hand those ghastly calls and still ghastlier silences are but an intimation of how the night is marching,novel

they smirked at each other and rubbed their hands,novel
i do that all the time with my friends. it's so cute when they do it to each other.,chit-chat

a different treatment was accorded to wendy who came last,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad they came last. what did they do?,chit-chat
with ironical politeness hook raised his hat to her and offering her his arm escorted her to the spot where the others were being gagged,novel
that's really nice of hook to do that. i'm sure he appreciated it.,chit-chat
he did it with such an air he was so frightfully _distingué_ that she was too fascinated to cry out,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm sure she felt the same way.,chit-chat
she was only a little girl,novel
how old was she when she was born? did she grow up to be a boy or a girl?,chit-chat
perhaps it is telltale to divulge that for a moment hook entranced her and we tell on her only because her slip led to strange results,novel
that's a good idea. i'm not sure if i want to tell her.,chit-chat
had she haughtily unhanded him and we should have loved to write it of her she would have been hurled through the air like the others and then hook would probably not have been present at the tying of the children and had he not been at the tying he would not have discovered slightlys secret and without the secret he could not presently have made his foul attempt on peters life,novel
that's a very interesting theory. i'm not familiar with it. what is slightlys secret?,chit-chat
they were tied to prevent their flying away doubled up with their knees close to their ears and for the trussing of them the black pirate had cut a rope into nine equal pieces,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i've never heard of the black pirate before. what's his name?",chit-chat
all went well until slightlys turn came when he was found to be like those irritating parcels that use up all the string in going round and leave no tags with which to tie a knot,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find him soon.,chit-chat
the pirates kicked him in their rage just as you kick the parcel though in fairness you should kick the string and strange to say it was hook who told them to belay their violence,novel
that's a good idea. i think i'll do that. thanks for the advice.,chit-chat
his lip was curled with malicious triumph,novel
"oh my god, i can't even imagine what that must have been like. i'm so sorry to hear that.",chit-chat
while his dogs were merely sweating because every time they tried to pack the unhappy lad tight in one part he bulged out in another hooks master mind had gone far beneath slightlys surface probing not for effects but for causes and his exultation showed that he had found them,novel
that's so sad. i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's ok.,chit-chat
slightly white to the gills knew that hook had surprised his secret which was this that no boy so blown out could use a tree wherein an average man need stick,novel
that's pretty cool. i've always wanted to learn how to use a stick.,chit-chat
poor slightly most wretched of all the children now for he was in a panic about peter bitterly regretted what he had done,novel
i can't imagine what it must have been like for him to be in a panic.,chit-chat
madly addicted to the drinking of water when he was hot he had swelled in consequence to his present girth and instead of reducing himself to fit his tree he had unknown to the others whittled his tree to make it fit him,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. did you find out why he was addicted to water?",chit-chat
sufficient of this hook guessed to persuade him that peter at last lay at his mercy but no word of the dark design that now formed in the subterranean caverns of his mind crossed his lips he merely signed that the captives were to be conveyed to the ship and that he would be alone,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i've never heard of a hook like that before.",chit-chat
how to convey them,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you talking about how to communicate?,chit-chat
hunched up in their ropes they might indeed be rolled down hill like barrels but most of the way lay through a morass,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm not sure i could do that.,chit-chat
again hooks genius surmounted difficulties,novel
i've never heard of another hooks genius before. what's the name of it?,chit-chat
he indicated that the little house must be used as a conveyance,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm not sure i could do that.,chit-chat
the children were flung into it four stout pirates raised it on their shoulders the others fell in behind and singing the hateful pirate chorus the strange procession set off through the wood,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. what do you do for a living? do you have any hobbies?,chit-chat
i dont know whether any of the children were crying if so the singing drowned the sound but as the little house disappeared in the forest a brave though tiny jet of smoke issued from its chimney as if defying hook,novel
"wow, that's scary. i'm glad it wasn't a big house.",chit-chat
hook saw it and it did peter a bad service,novel
hook saw it and it did peter a bad service. i'm sorry to hear that.,chit-chat
it dried up any trickle of pity for him that may have remained in the pirates infuriated breast,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find peace in your life.,chit-chat
the first thing he did on finding himself alone in the fast falling night was to tiptoe to slightlys tree and make sure that it provided him with a passage,novel
"oh wow, that's really interesting. what did he do to make sure it provided him with a passage?",chit-chat
then for long he remained brooding his hat of ill omen on the sward so that any gentle breeze which had arisen might play refreshingly through his hair,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he didn't die.,chit-chat
dark as were his thoughts his blue eyes were as soft as the periwinkle,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's doing better now. what happened to him?,chit-chat
intently he listened for any sound from the nether world but all was as silent below as above the house under the ground seemed to be but one more empty tenement in the void,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never heard of the nether world before. what's it like?,chit-chat
was that boy asleep or did he stand waiting at the foot of slightlys tree with his dagger in his hand,novel
"i think he was asleep. i don't know what happened to him, but i can't help but feel bad for him.",chit-chat
there was no way of knowing save by going down,novel
"that's true, but i'm not sure i'd be able to do that.",chit-chat
hook let his cloak slip softly to the ground and then biting his lips till a lewd blood stood on them he stepped into the tree,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never heard of hook before. what's his name?,chit-chat
he was a brave man but for a moment he had to stop there and wipe his brow which was dripping like a candle,novel
that's pretty brave of him. i'm glad he didn't have to do that.,chit-chat
then silently he let himself go into the unknown,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he didn't.,chit-chat
he arrived unmolested at the foot of the shaft and stood still again biting at his breath which had almost left him,novel
oh no! i hope he didn't have to go to the hospital or anything like that.,chit-chat
as his eyes became accustomed to the dim light various objects in the home under the trees took shape but the only one on which his greedy gaze rested long sought for and found at last was the great bed,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. what happened to the bed? did you find it?",chit-chat
on the bed lay peter fast asleep,novel
i've never heard of peter. what does he do for a living? do you like him?,chit-chat
unaware of the tragedy being enacted above peter had continued for a little time after the children left to play gaily on his pipes no doubt rather a forlorn attempt to prove to himself that he did not care,novel
i'm so sorry that happened to you. i hope you're doing better now.,chit-chat
then he decided not to take his medicine so as to grieve wendy,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he didn't take it.,chit-chat
then he lay down on the bed outside the coverlet to vex her still more for she had always tucked them inside it because you never know that you may not grow chilly at the turn of the night,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm sure she appreciated it.,chit-chat
then he nearly cried but it struck him how indignant she would be if he laughed instead so he laughed a haughty laugh and fell asleep in the middle of it,novel
that's pretty funny. i'm glad he didn't have to go to the hospital.,chit-chat
sometimes though not often he had dreams and they were more painful than the dreams of other boys,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
for hours he could not be separated from these dreams though he wailed piteously in them,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get through it.,chit-chat
they had to do i think with the riddle of his existence,novel
"i don't know what that means, but i'm not sure what it means.",chit-chat
at such times it had been wendys custom to take him out of bed and sit with him on her lap soothing him in dear ways of her own invention and when he grew calmer to put him back to bed before he quite woke up so that he should not know of the indignity to which she had subjected him,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. i've never heard of wendys before. what's his name?",chit-chat
but on this occasion he had fallen at once into a dreamless sleep,novel
oh no! i hope he is ok. i've had that happen to me before.,chit-chat
one arm dropped over the edge of the bed one leg was arched and the unfinished part of his laugh was stranded on his mouth which was open showing the little pearls,novel
oh my goodness! that must have been so embarrassing! did you have to go to the doctor?,chit-chat
thus defenceless hook found him,novel
i'm not familiar with defenceless hook. what does it mean to defenceive?,chit-chat
he stood silent at the foot of the tree looking across the chamber at his enemy,novel
that must have been very embarrassing. did you have to talk to him about it or did he just let you know?,chit-chat
did no feeling of compassion disturb his sombre breast,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you referring to the size of the breast?,chit-chat
the man was not wholly evil he loved flowers i have been told and sweet music he was himself no mean performer on the harpsichord and let it be frankly admitted the idyllic nature of the scene stirred him profoundly,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
mastered by his better self he would have returned reluctantly up the tree but for one thing,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm not sure i could do that.,chit-chat
what stayed him was peters impertinent appearance as he slept,novel
i don't know... i'm not sure. i think it's time for me to get out of the house.,chit-chat
the open mouth the drooping arm the arched knee they were such a personification of cockiness as taken together will never again one may hope be presented to eyes so sensitive to their offensiveness,novel
i'm not sure i understand what you're saying. are you saying that the drooping arm is a personification of cockiness as taken together will never again one may hope be presented to eyes so sensitive to their offensiveness?,chit-chat
they steeled hooks heart,novel
i'm a big fan of the hooks heart. it's one of my favorite songs.,chit-chat
if his rage had broken him into a hundred pieces every one of them would have disregarded the incident and leapt at the sleeper,novel
i don't think he would have been able to do that. i'm not sure how he would react.,chit-chat
though a light from the one lamp shone dimly on the bed hook stood in darkness himself and at the first stealthy step forward he discovered an obstacle the door of slightlys tree,novel
"wow, that's scary! did you find out who he was? did you see him?",chit-chat
it did not entirely fill the aperture and he had been looking over it,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's able to get over it.,chit-chat
feeling for the catch he found to his fury that it was low down beyond his reach,novel
that's awesome! i'm happy for him. i hope he's doing well.,chit-chat
to his disordered brain it seemed then that the irritating quality in peters face and figure visibly increased and he rattled the door and flung himself against it,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
was his enemy to escape him after all,novel
i don't think so. i think he was just trying to get away from me.,chit-chat
but what was that,novel
i don't know. i'm not sure what it was. i was so mad.,chit-chat
the red in his eye had caught sight of peters medicine standing on a ledge within easy reach,novel
"i've never heard peters medicine before, but i'm familiar with peters medicine. what is peters medicine?",chit-chat
he fathomed what it was straightaway and immediately knew that the sleeper was in his power,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad he didn't get hurt too bad.,chit-chat
lest he should be taken alive hook always carried about his person a dreadful drug blended by himself of all the deathdealing rings that had come into his possession,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a fan of drug use.",chit-chat
these he had boiled down into a yellow liquid quite unknown to science which was probably the most virulent poison in existence,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i've never heard of that. what was it?,chit-chat
five drops of this he now added to peters cup,novel
that's awesome! i'm so happy for him. he's such a great player.,chit-chat
his hand shook but it was in exultation rather than in shame,novel
oh no! i hope it didn't make you feel too bad about it. what did he do?,chit-chat
as he did it he avoided glancing at the sleeper but not lest pity should unnerve him merely to avoid spilling,novel
i don't blame him. i'm glad he didn't do it again.,chit-chat
then one long gloating look he cast upon his victim and turning wormed his way with difficulty up the tree,novel
that's so sad. i'm sorry you had to go through that. i hope you're doing better now.,chit-chat
as he emerged at the top he looked the very spirit of evil breaking from its hole,novel
that's a good way to look at it. what did you do to break it?,chit-chat
donning his hat at its most rakish angle he wound his cloak around him holding one end in front as if to conceal his person from the night of which it was the blackest part and muttering strangely to himself stole away through the trees,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. did you find out who did it or did you just assume he did it?",chit-chat
peter slept on,novel
peter is one of my favorite artists. he's one of the best selling artists of all time.,chit-chat
the light guttered and went out leaving the tenement in darkness but still he slept,novel
oh no! that must have been so scary! did he get up and go to sleep?,chit-chat
it must have been not less than ten oclock by the crocodile when he suddenly sat up in his bed wakened by he knew not what,novel
that's so funny! i've never seen a crocodile in my life. what kind of crocodile is it?,chit-chat
it was a soft cautious tapping on the door of his tree,novel
that's a good thing to be cautious about. do you think he'll come back?,chit-chat
soft and cautious but in that stillness it was sinister,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope it wasn't too bad for you.,chit-chat
peter felt for his dagger till his hand gripped it,novel
that's pretty cool. what did peter do with it? i'm not familiar with him.,chit-chat
then he spoke,novel
what did he say? i don't think i've heard of him speaking before.,chit-chat
who is that for long there was no answer then again the knock,novel
i'm not sure. i've never been able to find out who he is.,chit-chat
who are you no answer,novel
i'm not sure. i've been trying to figure it out for a while.,chit-chat
he was thrilled and he loved being thrilled,novel
that's great! i'm happy for him. what did he do to make you happy?,chit-chat
in two strides he reached the door,novel
that's a good thing. i'm sure he didn't want to get into trouble.,chit-chat
unlike slightlys door it filled the aperture so that he could not see beyond it nor could the one knocking see him,novel
slightlys door filled the aperture so that he could not see beyond it nor could the one knocking see him,chit-chat
i wont open unless you speak peter cried,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. why won't you open unless you speak peter cried?,chit-chat
then at last the visitor spoke in a lovely belllike voice,novel

let me in peter it was tink and quickly he unbarred to her,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you were able to get away from him.,chit-chat
she flew in excitedly her face flushed and her dress stained with mud,novel
that's not good. i hope she didn't have to clean up after herself.,chit-chat
what is it oh you could never guess she cried and offered him three guesses,novel
that's so sweet of her. i'm so happy for her. she's such a good person.,chit-chat

it was not such a night as he would have chosen,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to make it up to him.,chit-chat

he regretted now that he had given the birds of the island such strange names that they are very wild and difficult of approach,novel

there was no other course but to press forward in redskin fashion at which happily he was an adept,novel

he had taught the children something of the forest lore that he had himself learned from tiger lily and tinker bell and knew that in their dire hour they were not likely to forget it,novel
that's really cool. i've never heard of tinker bell. what's his name?,chit-chat
slightly if he had an opportunity would blaze the trees for instance curly would drop seeds and wendy would leave her handkerchief at some important place,novel

she was the cannibal of the seas and scarce needed that watchful eye for she floated immune in the horror of her name,novel
"i've never heard of scarce, but i'm familiar with scarce. what's his name?",chit-chat
she was wrapped in the blanket of night through which no sound from her could have reached the shore,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you were able to get to her.,chit-chat
there was little sound and none agreeable save the whir of the ships sewing machine at which smee sat ever industrious and obliging the essence of the commonplace pathetic smee,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did smee do to make you so angry?,chit-chat
i know not why he was so infinitely pathetic unless it were because he was so pathetically unaware of it but even strong men had to turn hastily from looking at him and more than once on summer evenings he had touched the fount of hooks tears and made it flow,novel
i don't know why he was so pathetic. i think he was just trying to make himself feel better.,chit-chat
of this as of almost everything else smee was quite unconscious,novel
i can't believe smee is still alive. i'm so glad she's gone.,chit-chat
a few of the pirates leant over the bulwarks drinking in the miasma of the night others sprawled by barrels over games of dice and cards and the exhausted four who had carried the little house lay prone on the deck where even in their sleep they rolled skillfully to this side or that out of hooks reach lest he should claw them mechanically in passing,novel
"wow, that sounds like a lot of fun. do you have any other hobbies?",chit-chat
hook trod the deck in thought,novel

that's so sad. i'm sorry to hear that. what happened to peter?,chit-chat
it was his grimmest deed since the days when he had brought barbecue to heel and knowing as we do how vain a tabernacle is man could we be surprised had he now paced the deck unsteadily bellied out by the winds of his success,novel
that's a great way to look at it. i'm glad he's doing well.,chit-chat
but there was no elation in his gait which kept pace with the action of his sombre mind,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you referring to the lack of elation in his gait?,chit-chat
hook was profoundly dejected,novel
"i don't know about you, but i'm not a big fan of hook.",chit-chat

it was because he was so terribly alone,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did he do to make you feel that way?,chit-chat

hook was not his true name,novel
what is his true name? i've never heard of hook before. what's his?,chit-chat
to reveal who he really was would even at this date set the country in a blaze but as those who read between the lines must already have guessed he had been at a famous public school and its traditions still clung to him like garments with which indeed they are largely concerned,novel
that's so sad. i'm sorry you had to go through that. i hope he's doing better now.,chit-chat
thus it was offensive to him even now to board a ship in the same dress in which he grappled her and he still adhered in his walk to the schools distinguished slouch,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's able to get over it.,chit-chat
but above all he retained the passion for good form,novel
"that's true, but i'm not sure if he's going to do it again.",chit-chat
good form,novel
i've been working on my form lately. i'm trying to get better at it.,chit-chat
however much he may have degenerated he still knew that this is all that really matters,novel
"that's true, but i still feel bad for him. i don't know what to do.",chit-chat
from far within him he heard a creaking as of rusty portals and through them came a stern taptaptap like hammering in the night when one can not sleep,novel
"oh my god, that's terrifying! i'm terrified of portals, too.",chit-chat
have you been good form today was their eternal question,novel
i've been pretty good. i think i'm going to do better next time.,chit-chat

i am the only man whom barbecue feared he urged and flint feared barbecue barbecue flintwhat house came the cutting retort,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i've never been to a barbecue barbecue house.,chit-chat
most disquieting reflection of all was it not bad form to think about good form,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad you're feeling better about it.,chit-chat
his vitals were tortured by this problem,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. do you think he's going to get better?,chit-chat
it was a claw within him sharper than the iron one and as it tore him the perspiration dripped down his tallow countenance and streaked his doublet,novel
"wow, that's pretty intense. i'm glad you were able to get away with it.",chit-chat
ofttimes he drew his sleeve across his face but there was no damming that trickle,novel
what did he do to make you think he drew his sleeve across his face? what did you do?,chit-chat
ah envy not hook,novel
i'm not sure what you mean. are you saying that envy isn't hook?,chit-chat
there came to him a presentiment of his early dissolution,novel

hook felt a gloomy desire to make his dying speech lest presently there should be no time for it,novel
i'm not familiar with hook. what's his name? is he a rapper?,chit-chat
better for hook he cried if he had had less ambition it was in his darkest hours only that he referred to himself in the third person,novel
i don't think i've ever heard of hook. what's his name?,chit-chat
no little children to love me strange that he should think of this which had never troubled him before perhaps the sewing machine brought it to his mind,novel
that's a good point. i'm not sure why he didn't think of that.,chit-chat
for long he muttered to himself staring at smee who was hemming placidly under the conviction that all children feared him,novel
"oh my god, that's terrible. i'm so sorry to hear about that.",chit-chat
feared him,novel
i don't know if i could do that. i think i'd be too scared.,chit-chat

there was not a child on board the brig that night who did not already love him,novel
that's so sad. i'm sorry to hear that. what did he do?,chit-chat
he had said horrid things to them and hit them with the palm of his hand because he could not hit with his fist but they had only clung to him the more,novel
"wow, that's terrible. i'm sorry to hear that. what did he say?",chit-chat
michael had tried on his spectacles,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. what did michael try to do with his spectacles?,chit-chat
to tell poor smee that they thought him lovable,novel
what did smee do to make you think he was lovable? what did he do?,chit-chat
hook itched to do it but it seemed too brutal,novel
hook itched to do it but it seemed too brutal but it was too brutal for me.,chit-chat
instead he revolved this mystery in his mind why do they find smee lovable,novel
i don't know... i'm not sure. i think it's a mystery.,chit-chat
he pursued the problem like the sleuthhound that he was,novel
i love sleuthhounds! they're so cute and playful. what was the problem?,chit-chat
if smee was lovable what was it that made him so,novel
i don't know... i'm not sure what made him so lovable.,chit-chat
a terrible answer suddenly presented itselfgood form had the bosun good form without knowing it which is the best form of all,novel
what is itselfgood form? i've never heard of it. what is it?,chit-chat
he remembered that you have to prove you dont know you have it before you are eligible for pop,novel
"that's true, but it's hard to prove that you don't have it.",chit-chat
with a cry of rage he raised his iron hand over smees head but he did not tear,novel
that's so sad. i'm sorry to hear that. what did he do?,chit-chat
what arrested him was this reflection to claw a man because he is good form what would that be bad form the unhappy hook was as impotent as he was damp and he fell forward like a cut flower,novel
what arrested him was this reflection to claw a man because he is good form what would that be bad form the unhappy hook was as impotence as he was damp and he fell forward like a cut flower,chit-chat

that's so sad. i'm sorry you had to go through that. i hope you're ok.,chit-chat
for a time he seemed unconscious of their presence,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he didn't get hurt.,chit-chat
he lolled at his ease humming not unmelodiously snatches of a rude song and fingering a pack of cards,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to get over it.,chit-chat
ever and anon the light from his cigar gave a touch of colour to his face,novel
i'm not sure what you're talking about. are you talking about something else?,chit-chat
now then bullies he said briskly six of you walk the plank tonight but i have room for two cabin boys,novel
"wow, that's a lot of bullies. i'm sorry to hear that.",chit-chat
which of you is it to be dont irritate him unnecessarily had been wendys instructions in the hold so tootles stepped forward politely,novel
i don't know... i'm not sure what to do about it.,chit-chat
tootles hated the idea of signing under such a man but an instinct told him that it would be prudent to lay the responsibility on an absent person and though a somewhat silly boy he knew that mothers alone are always willing to be the buffer,novel
that's so funny! i love tootles. he's one of my favorite comedians.,chit-chat
all children know this about mothers and despise them for it but make constant use of it,novel
that's so true. it's like they don't even know what they're doing.,chit-chat
so tootles explained prudently you see sir i dont think my mother would like me to be a pirate,novel

shall we still be respectful subjects of the king john inquired,novel
i'm not sure what you mean by that. are you referring to the president of the united states?,chit-chat

i don't know if i could swear down with the king. i'm not sure i'd trust him.,chit-chat
then i refuse he cried banging the barrel in front of hook,novel

"i don't know why they would despise them. i mean, they have been around for a long time.",chit-chat
to the boys there was at least some glamour in the pirate calling but all that she saw was that the ship had not been tidied for years,novel

very frightful was it to see the change that came over him,novel
"yes, it was very frightful. i'm glad he's doing better now.",chit-chat
it was as if he had been clipped at every joint,novel
that's what i was thinking. i'm glad he's doing so well.,chit-chat
he fell in a little heap,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope he's ok. what did he do?,chit-chat
the sound came steadily nearer and in advance of it came this ghastly thought the crocodile is about to board the ship even the iron claw hung inactive as if knowing that it was no intrinsic part of what the attacking force wanted,novel
"wow, that's scary. i hope you didn't hurt the crocodile too much.",chit-chat
left so fearfully alone any other man would have lain with his eyes shut where he fell but the gigantic brain of hook was still working and under its guidance he crawled on the knees along the deck as far from the sound as he could go,novel
"wow, that's pretty intense. i'm not sure if i could do that.",chit-chat
the pirates respectfully cleared a passage for him and it was only when he brought up against the bulwarks that he spoke,novel
that's cool. i've never been a big fan of the bulwarks.,chit-chat
hide me he cried hoarsely,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. what did he do to make you feel that way?,chit-chat
they gathered round him all eyes averted from the thing that was coming aboard,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he didn't get hurt.,chit-chat
they had no thought of fighting it,novel
that's what i'm thinking. i don't know what to do about it.,chit-chat
it was fate,novel
"i'm not sure what that means, but i know it's a good movie.",chit-chat
only when hook was hidden from them did curiosity loosen the limbs of the boys so that they could rush to the ships side to see the crocodile climbing it,novel
"wow, that's really interesting. i didn't know there was a crocodile on the ship side.",chit-chat
then they got the strangest surprise of the night of nights for it was no crocodile that was coming to their aid,novel
"oh no, that's terrible. i'm sorry you had to go through that.",chit-chat
it was peter,novel
i love peter! he's my favorite character. what's your favorite peter character?,chit-chat
he signed to them not to give vent to any cry of admiration that might rouse suspicion,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he didn't do that.,chit-chat
then he went on ticking,novel
"i'm not sure what that means, but i don't know what it means.",chit-chat
chapter xv,novel
i'm a big fan of chapter chapter. it's a collection of chapters that take place in the past.,chit-chat
hook or me this time odd things happen to all of us on our way through life without our noticing for a time that they have happened,novel

thus to take an instance we suddenly discover that we have been deaf in one ear for we dont know how long but say half an hour,novel
"wow, that must have been nerve wracking. did you have to go to the doctor?",chit-chat
now such an experience had come that night to peter,novel
what happened to peter? i haven't seen him in a long time. what happened?,chit-chat
when last we saw him he was stealing across the island with one finger to his lips and his dagger at the ready,novel
"oh wow, i didn't see that. what did he do? did he steal anything?",chit-chat
he had seen the crocodile pass by without noticing anything peculiar about it but by and by he remembered that it had not been ticking,novel
that's really interesting. did you find out who it was? did you catch it?,chit-chat
at first he thought this eerie but soon concluded rightly that the clock had run down,novel
that's pretty cool. did you find out who it was at the end of the day?,chit-chat
without giving a thought to what might be the feelings of a fellowcreature thus abruptly deprived of its closest companion peter began to consider how he could turn the catastrophe to his own use and he decided to tick so that wild beasts should believe he was the crocodile and let him pass unmolested,novel
"wow, that's interesting. i've never heard of a crocodile before. what kind of crocodile is it?",chit-chat
he ticked superbly but with one unforeseen result,novel
that's awesome! i'm so happy for him. i hope he's doing well in the future.,chit-chat
the crocodile was among those who heard the sound and it followed him though whether with the purpose of regaining what it had lost or merely as a friend under the belief that it was again ticking itself will never be certainly known for like slaves to a fixed idea it was a stupid beast,novel
that's interesting. i didn't know that. do you have a source for that?,chit-chat
peter reached the shore without mishap and went straight on his legs encountering the water as if quite unaware that they had entered a new element,novel
"hello, peter. how are you doing today? i hope you are doing well, peter!",chit-chat
thus many animals pass from land to water but no other human of whom i know,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. do you know any animals that pass from land to water?,chit-chat
as he swam he had but one thought hook or me this time he had ticked so long that he now went on ticking without knowing that he was doing it,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad he didn't think he was doing it.,chit-chat
had he known he would have stopped for to board the brig by help of the tick though an ingenious idea had not occurred to him,novel
i don't think so. i think he just didn't know what to do.,chit-chat
on the contrary he thought he had scaled her side as noiseless as a mouse and he was amazed to see the pirates cowering from him with hook in their midst as abject as if he had heard the crocodile,novel
that's pretty cool. i've never seen a crocodile before. what kind of crocodile is it?,chit-chat
the crocodile,novel
the crocodile is one of my favorite animals. it's one of the first species to be domesticated.,chit-chat
no sooner did peter remember it than he heard the ticking,novel
i don't think so. i'm pretty sure he didn't hear it.,chit-chat
at first he thought the sound did come from the crocodile and he looked behind him swiftly,novel
that's pretty cool. i'm glad he didn't get hurt too bad.,chit-chat
then he realised that he was doing it himself and in a flash he understood the situation,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he learned his lesson.,chit-chat
how clever of me he thought at once and signed to the boys not to burst into applause,novel
that's really smart of him. i'm sure he didn't know what he was doing.,chit-chat

it took about a week and a half. it's been a long time since i've done it.,chit-chat
one slightly had begun to count,novel
"oh, that's a bummer. i'm sorry to hear that. what happened?",chit-chat

that's pretty funny. i'm not sure what you're trying to say.,chit-chat
they could hear each others distressed breathing now which showed them that the more terrible sound had passed,novel
that's interesting. i've never heard that before. do you know what caused it?,chit-chat
its gone captain smee said wiping off his spectacles,novel
that's too bad. i hope smee can find a way to make it back.,chit-chat
alls still again slowly hook let his head emerge from his ruff and listened so intently that he could have caught the echo of the tick,novel
that's a good way to look at it. i'm glad he's doing well.,chit-chat
there was not a sound and he drew himself up firmly to his full height,novel
"oh wow, that's scary. i hope he didn't get hurt too bad.",chit-chat
then heres to johnny plank he cried brazenly hating the boys more than ever because they had seen him unbend,novel
that's so sad. i'm sorry to hear that. what happened to him?,chit-chat
he broke into the villainous ditty yo ho yo ho the frisky plank you walks along it so till it goes down and you goes down to davy jones below to terrorise the prisoners the more though with a certain loss of dignity he danced along an imaginary plank grimacing at them as he sang and when he finished he cried do you want a touch of the cat before you walk the plank at that they fell on their knees,novel
"i'm not sure what you're trying to say, but i don't get it.",chit-chat

they followed him with their eyes they scarce knew that hook had resumed his song his dogs joining in with him yo ho yo ho the scratching cat its tails are nine you know and when theyre writ upon your back what was the last line will never be known for of a sudden the song was stayed by a dreadful screech from the cabin,novel
"oh my god, i can't believe i've never heard of this song before.",chit-chat
it wailed through the ship and died away,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope you're ok. what happened?,chit-chat
then was heard a crowing sound which was well understood by the boys but to the pirates was almost more eerie than the screech,novel
"wow, that's pretty scary. i'm glad you were able to get out of there.",chit-chat
what was that cried hook,novel
"i don't know what it is, but i can't stop listening to it.",chit-chat

"oh my god, that's so scary! i'm so sorry to hear that.",chit-chat

"wow, that's pretty scary. did you find out who it was or did you have to call the police?",chit-chat
first signing them to hide peter cut wendys bonds and then nothing could have been easier than for them all to fly off together but one thing barred the way an oath hook or me this time so when he had freed wendy he whispered for her to conceal herself with the others and himself took her place by the mast her cloak around him so that he should pass for her,novel
i'm sorry to hear that. i hope you're able to find someone else.,chit-chat

"wow, that sounds like a lot of fun. did you get to see any of the other crew members?",chit-chat
man to man they were the stronger but they fought on the defensive only which enabled the boys to hunt in pairs and choose their quarry,novel
that sounds like a lot of fun. i'm glad they were able to do that.,chit-chat
some of the miscreants leapt into the sea others hid in dark recesses where they were found by slightly who did not fight but ran about with a lantern which he flashed in their faces so that they were half blinded and fell as an easy prey to the reeking swords of the other boys,novel
"wow, that must have been scary. how did they manage to get out of the sea?",chit-chat

"wow, that's impressive. i've never heard of a swordsman before.",chit-chat
hook scarcely his inferior in brilliancy but not quite so nimble in wrist play forced him back by the weight of his onset hoping suddenly to end all with a favourite thrust taught him long ago by barbecue at rio but to his astonishment he found this thrust turned aside again and again,novel
i'm so sorry to hear that. i hope he's okay. what happened?,chit-chat
then he sought to close and give the quietus with his iron hook which all this time had been pawing the air but peter doubled under it and lunging fiercely pierced him in the ribs,novel
"wow, that's intense. i'm glad he didn't get hurt too bad.",chit-chat
at the sight of his own blood whose peculiar colour you remember was offensive to him the sword fell from hooks hand and he was at peters mercy,novel

and again and again he darted in and pricked,novel

hook was fighting now without hope,novel
"i'm not a big fan of hook, but i can't wait to see what he brings to the table.",chit-chat
